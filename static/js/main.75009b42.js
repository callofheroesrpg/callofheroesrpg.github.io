Bv=JSON.parse('{"About The Game":{"What is Questguard?":"Questguard is a modern tabletop roleplaying game for the younger generations who are more familiar with video games (and board games), and want a fast, rules-light alternative to the mainstream combat RPG systems, like D&D and Pathfinder. The game is easy to learn, play, and game-master, and provides tons of combat options and strategies packed in a simple set of rules for both the players and the QM.\\nWe created this game out of love for tabletop roleplaying games to account for our personal needs and wants.\\nIt is a game in the same genre as D&D and Pathfinder: it\'s made for a fantasy setting, has turn based combat, and standard roleplaying in social scenarios. If you\'ve played similar games before, you will find Questguard very easy to pick up!\\n","Is this a D&D offspin?":"No. It\'s a different game. However, Dungeons and Dragons and Pathfinder are some of the main inspiration sources for Questguard.\\nWhile exploring Questguard, you will find similarities to mainstream games like World of Warcraft, Divinity, Descent, and even League of Legends, all to create an easy and familiar experience to new tabletop players, and veterans alike!\\n","Why Questguard and not D&D?":"Blalaflala\\n"},"CoH For D&D Players":{"D12 System":"Questguard is a d12 system instead of d20. When you make a check, you roll a 12-sided die and add any modifiers to it. This leads to less swingy Checks and makes adding numbers easier.\\nCritical successes and failures can happen when rolling a d12 - if you roll 12 on the die, that counts as a Critical Success and it is treated as 15.\\nRolling a natural 1 is not considered a Critical failure. Instead, a Critical Failure happens when your total result is 0 or less (from a negative modifier, like having -1 in a certain Stat).\\n\\nWhen in combat, there is no rolling to hit - you roll Damage directly, and what you see is what you get! If you rolled a total of 14 on 3d6, you deal 14 Damage.\\nCritical Strikes do exist in combat, but are specific to various weapons and Spells. If a weapon or Spell can Critically Strike, it is neatly mentioned in the description text (with what needs to happen for it to be a Critical Strike).\\n","Characters":"This section explains the basics of the player characters. Later sections describe how combat works and how Quest Mastering is different from other systems.\\nLike in D&D, a character needs to have a Character Sheet, which can be downloaded from Database, Other, Character Sheet (PDF).\\nA character is defined by a Race and a Class (there is no background). Each Class has a different set of specializations (e.g. Paladin orders, Druid covens, etc) and each Race a set of extra colorful Ability options.\\nEach Specialization provides tons of options for character customization through Talents every 2 Levels!\\n","Player Character Progression":"In Questguard, characters go from Level 1 up to Level 10. In terms of how much time and experience it takes to get from 1 to 10, it\'s not the equivalent of getting from 1 to 20 in D&D.\\nIn fact, getting from Level 1 to Level 10 in Questguard is slightly faster than going from Level 1 to Level 10 in Dungeons and Dragons.\\n\\nHowever, the levels are packed and flavorful, with constant game-changer options!\\nEvery 2 Levels, you get to pick a class Talent from 3 to 4 choices. These are Talents are usually powerful Abilities that define your playstyle! Thus, judging only by the number of Talents, each Specialization has over 500 possible Talent combinations, all viable!\\nLeveling up happens either through Experience Points awarded by the QM (from killing monsters, completing puzzles, etc) or through a milestone system (e.g. leveling up after completing a certain part of the story).\\n","Character Stats":"Ability Scores (from D&D) are called simply Stats in Questguard.\\nThere are 5 Stats in Questguard: Might, Dexterity, Intelligence, Sense and Charisma.\\nStrength and Constitution are combined into one single stat: Might. Might affects Damage with some weapons and your base Health. The overall Health is determined more by your Class and Talents rather than by your Might. So don\'t worry! You\'re not losing on that much Health if you choose to start with -1 Might.\\nWhen you create your character, you assign the following numbers in any order to your Stats: 3, 2, 1, 0, -1. Every Character will have some strong Stats and some weak Stats.\\nThere are no tables for converting a Stat to a Modifier like in D&D. The Stats themselves are the modifiers.\\nYou gain extra Stat Points at Levels 4 and 8 (and maybe through some Talents).\\nYou might be thinking about how Races affect your Stats. Instead of giving you extra points in some Stats, Races impose some extra rules for distributing Stats. For example, Orcs allow you to put assign your Stats however you like, as long as your Might is at least 2.\\n\\nUnlike in D&D, there are no sub-stat Skills (Athletics, Perception, etc). Instead, all Checks are done directly with the Stat, and in some circumstances, players can choose which Stat they want to use. A QM might call for a simple Dexterity check to sneak around a sleeping ogre.\\nInstead, to specialize in different skills, there exist non-combat Skills, which are open-ended and give you a bonus equal to your Level to certain Checks. So, even if your Intelligence is low, you might still know a lot about Occultism.\\nFor example, if you have Skilled in Intimidation, you will get a bonus to all rolls for intimidating, whether you want to use your Charisma or something else - perhaps you want to intimidate a battle general with your superior knowledge in war, and might roll an Intelligence Check for intimidating him!\\n","Combat, Turns and Actions":"Just like in D&D, combat happens on a map (preferably on a grid), and measurement is in meters instead of feet (each square is a 1x1 meter space).\\nEach player rolls Initiative (1d12 + Initiative) to determine their turn order. Monsters have a fixed Initiative, so similar monster groups take their turns at the same time, thus increasing the speed of preparation for combat.\\n\\nIn a turn, a Unit can move up to its speed and use 1 Action, which can be divided into 2 Half-Actions. As a general rule of thumb, an action taking 2 hands usually costs 1 Action. If it can be done with one hand, it usually takes a half action.\\nDon\'t worry though! Each Ability is well worded and specifies how many Actions it takes to make.\\n\\nThere is no Bonus Action, but there are plenty of Abilities that cost 0 Actions (are completely free and can do as many as you like per turn).\\nLike in D&D, each Unit also has a Reaction they can use during other Units\' turns for some situational moves.\\n\\nSaving Throws are called Resist Checks and are rolled with the Stat Modifier. Some Talents and Abilities grant you bonus modifiers to certain Resist Checks.\\n","Moving":"Inherit from Rules.yml","Abilities":"An Ability can either mean a spell, a feature, a passive trait, etc. It\'s an all-encompassing word for \\"something you can do\\". Flamebolt is an Ability that requires 1 Aciton; Hamstring is an Ability that costs a Half-Action (you could do it twice per turn); Recuperate is an Ability that costs 0 Actions, so, as long as you have enough Mana, you can spam Recuperate as much as you want on your turn! Big Eyes is also an Ability, but it\'s passive, meaning it has an effect that is always on, and you don\'t need to do it manually on your turn.\\nAbilities are very straight forward and usually short, and if any extra explanations are needed, they are written in fine print at the bottom of the text box.\\nAside from the name and marvelously illustrated icon, each Ability has tags for how many Actions it takes, its range, cost, etc. One quick way to differentiate Passive from Active Abilities is that Active Abilities have a square icon, while Passive Abilities have a rounder icon.\\n\\nSpells do not have a verbal or material component requirement, and can be just cast at will.\\nTidbit - there is a type of Crowd Control called Silence that completely blocks the flow of magic of a caster and prevents all spells from being cast.\\n\\nThere are some exceptions to all these, of course, but if it\'s an exception, you\'ll see it written explicitly in the Ability box.\\n","Adventures and Rests":"In Questguard, there are no Long Rests or Short Rests. Instead, there is the concept of an Adventure.\\nAn Adventure is a period of gameplay defined by the QM. An Adventure could be one full dungeon, one quest, one session, or just one day outdoors adventuring.\\nYou regain spent resources inbetween Adventures.\\n","Spell Casting Systems":"There are two equivalents to the Spell Slot mechanic of D&D: Mana and Cooldowns.\\n\\nAll Classes (spellcasters or not) use Mana to cast Abilities.\\nMana functions exactly like Spell Slots, but are not categorised by levels. An Ability costs a number of Mana points, which the Player Character will expend to cast that Ability.\\nThus, if you have 5 Mana (that recovers on Long Rest), you can choose to spend 2 of it on a Spell that costs 2 Mana. You\'ll be left with 3 Mana for the rest of the Adventure.\\nYou can prepare a number of Abilities from its available lists of Basic Abilities (Bloodshed, Elemental, Conjuration, Warfare, Divine, etc) and have them ready to cast. Most of the time, prepared Spells can be changed inbetween Adventures.\\nSome Spells do have a character Level requirements, though! Fire Ball is only usable by Level 4 or above characters!\\n","Cooldowns":"Cooldown is a term borrowed from video games. It refers to a time you must wait between casts. If an Ability has a cooldown of Once / Adventure, it means you can\'t use it again until the next Adventure.\\nCooldowns are generally not based on time, but rather on checkpoints. Once per combat, once per Adventure, once per Turn, etc.      \\n","Done!":"That is the breakdown of the base rules!

Clal of Heroes can be seen as a better alternative to Dungeons and Dragons, with more player-friendly (and clearly written) rules, mechanics that area easier to understand, more intriguing options and digitally modern. Described directly, it\'s cleverly simple, modern and plainly cool! Like the games it draw inspiration from, Questguard is a combat-oriented game. While optional, fighting is a key part of Questguard. It is one aspect that Questguard excels at over its alternatives: combat is faster, more dynamic and more interesting overall, with simpler rules, but more possibilities for strategies and tactics. Combat usually happens on a grid of squares, with every player and monster taking turns to move, attack and cast magic spells!\\nUnlike RPG video games (World of Warcraft, Skyrim, etc), in tabletop RPG\'s, a Quest Master can create any world and story they want (based on some rules) and players can essentially do anything they want in that world or story, without being limited to narrow dialogue options or only certain mechanics.\\nIn a tabletop RPG, the players can do _anything_ (or at least try)! It becomes the Quest Master\'s responsibility to narrate what happens, play the role of non-player characters and monsters, come up with fair encounters and make the experience fun for the players. Having fun is the most important!\\nThe Quest Master is not the player\'s enemy - it is the narrator, referee and, usually, host of the game; their goal is to provide exciting experiences and stories for the players and keep the game balanced and impartial.\\n\\nA tabletop RPG is not constrained by graphics. A lot of people play on a table, with grids/mats and miniatures as characters (like in a board game). But this is not entirely necessary! Many people play without any visual aid at all, and it\'s all \\"theater of the mind\\"!\\nNowadays, there are online platforms to play tabletop RPG\'s. These offer the Quest Master tools for creating maps, \\"tokens\\" that represent player characters and enemies (like 2D sprites or even 3D models that can be placed on the map) and even playing environmental music.\\nAnd like in a board game, there are rules for both players and the Quest Master to ensure that the game is fair and fun for everyone. Every player\'s character must have strengths and weaknesses.\\n\\nWhen players want to do something, like shooting a bow or negotiating with an NPC, the result is often determined by rolling dice.\\n","How do groups work?":"If you want to play, sometimes it\'s as easy as creating a character outside of a game, finding a group to play with via an online platform and just joining the game.\\nHowever, tabletop RPG\'s can be so much more than just a one-time experience!\\n\\nMany QM\'s choose to run \'campaigns\', which is a series of game sessions that continue from one play session to another, and expand into an overarching story and develop the players\' characters\' personalities and powers.\\nThus, if you want it to be a more intricate experience, you should find a group that fits you; make sure you get on well with everyone else and everyone is on the same page when it comes to playing.\\n\\nEach QM is different. A QM might run a story based on the Lord of the Rings books or in some made up world. Some QM\'s have different styles of playing - some are more focused on telling a story, others are more focused on giving the players options. Some are friendly, some... less so.\\nUltimately, just like finding a group to play board games with, you all should have roughly the same expectations and mindset. Some games are more relaxed, drinking and eating pizza. Some are more intense and take things seriously. If you find a group, make sure you ask what kind of group they are.\\n\\nMost groups have one Quest Master and between 3 and 6 other players who play as individual characters.\\nThe recommended sweet spot for Questguard is one Quest Master and 4 to 5 other players.\\n\\nA play session can last as long as the group desires. Usually, you should dedicate at least 1:30 to 2 hours to a play session. A lot of players find they want to keep going after that, since time flies fast when you\'re having fun and making progress through the story!\\n","How is it different from a board game?":"A board game is limited by its physical pieces (cards, miniatures, board, etc).\\nA tabletop RPG does not have to be limited by anything.\\nWhen you buy a board game, you expect to be able to play the whole game with everything that comes in the box.\\nHowever, to play Questguard, you don\'t need anything from the box. In fact, you don\'t even need to buy anything! Don\'t want to buy mats or print out maps? Use sheets of paper and draw the board on them directly. Don\'t have miniatures? Use pretzels and bottle caps (sounds stupid, but it works; and we\'re also pretty sure you can find better replacements for them as well).\\nThere is no stigma in the tabletop roleplaying community for improvizing your own gaming set. In fact, it\'s encouraged! Many people like making terrain and props to use in their tabletop games.\\n","What is a story or adventure like?":"Slay monsters, get treasure\\nThe 3 pillars (33% each)\\n","What should I buy to get started?":"Nothing.\\nAll you need to play are the rules and, of course, a group of people.\\nAll the rules for the players are free and accessible online on this website.\\nWe do, though, recommend you get a set of D&D Dice (it contains a 4-sided die, 6-sided die, 8-sided die, 10-sided die, 12-sided die and 20-sided die). Rolling dice is a very fun aspect of tabletop RPG\'s! However, if you don\'t have access to a set of dice, there are plenty mobile or online apps that simulate dice rolling. You should be able to buy a generic set of such dice for a maximum of $10 at a gaming store (as of 2022).\\n","How do I get started?":"It might be daunting to learn all the rules by yourself. But fret not; since Questguard is mainly inspired by Dungeons and Dragons, you fill find a lot of people who play D&D and will be willing to try CoH with you!\\nThe easiest way to get started is to find someone who already knows how to play Questguard and ask to join their game, or ask them to host a game for you and some other friends.\\nIf you want to try Questguard specifically and you have experience with Dungeons and Dragons (5th edition or One D&D), see the page \\"D&D to CoH transition guide\\". It will provide you an easy introduction to Questguard from a D&D perspective.\\nIf you never played a tabletop RPG but you have friends who have played Dungeons and Dragons, send them a link to the \\"D&D to CoH transition guide\\" page!\\nIf you decide to play online, there are several platforms for playing Questguard that simulate real life tables with miniatures, dice, music, etc. As of 2023, the most popular such platform is Roll20 (https://roll20.net). It is free for all players and Quest Masters alike and supports many roleplaying games, including Questguard.\\n","Learning the Rules":"Feel free to follow this guide to learn how to play the game. Both in the book and on the official website, you will find clarifications for each and every rule. When in doubt, search it up on the website or consult the table of contents of the book for that rule.\\nAside from this written guide, there is also a video guide for both new and experienced roleplayers on our official YouTube channel or on the official Questguard website.\\n\\nTo be a player in a game, you need a Character! Don\'t worry about creating a character for now.\\nFor the rest of this guide, assume you are playing as a short and skinny, sneaky Gnome. That is your character! We\'ll name him Don. Yes, in this story, you are Don.\\n","Checking the Rules":"If you ever find something ambiguous, there is probably a rule for it on the official website. Just search the exact phrase or words that are unclear and you will most likely find an explanation!\\n","Dice":"Before we begin, you need to know about dice.\\nDice rolling is a core component of Questguard. Whatever you want to do, it is likely you will need to roll a die for it to determine if you succeed or fail, either as a Player Character or as an NPC or monster.\\nIn the world of tabletop roleplaying, there exists one standard set of \\"polyhedral\\" dice - whether they are Dungeons and Dragons dice or Pathfinder dice, they are all the same and they all work.\\nA set of such dice contains 7 special dice: a 4-sided die, a 6-sided die, an 8-sided die, two 10-sided dice, a 12-sided die and a 20-sided die. Only one such set will suffice for playing Questguard to its full extent, though the more dice you have, the merrier!\\nEach of these dice contains one number on each face: the 4-sided die goes from 1 to 4, the 6-sided die (normal die) goes from 1 to 6, and so on.\\nWherever you live, you can buy a set of roleplaying dice for less than $10 (as of 2023), usually at a board game shop or a gaming store, or, if you can\'t find any, you can order them online. If you can\'t afford that, there are plenty of mobile dice simulators. Just search \\"dice\\" on your mobile application store and there should be several free applications that mimick dice rolling!\\nIf you decide to play online and not at a real table, however, you don\'t need to buy dice and can just use online dice rolling simulators. There are many platforms for online roleplaying and they all incorporate dice rolling simulators.\\n","Dice notation and calculations":"Whenever you see a notation like \\"d4\\", \\"d6\\", \\"d8\\", etc, these mean \\"4-sided die\\", \\"6-sided die\\", \\"8-sided die\\", etc.\\nSo, a die with 4 sides is called a \\"d4\\", a die with 6 sides is called a \\"d6\\", etc. \\nIf you see \\"d4\\", that means you\'re supposed to roll a 4-sided die and take that result.\\nIf you see \\"d6\\", that means you\'re supposed to roll a 6-sided die and take that result. And so on and so forth.\\n\\nIf you are ever in doubt about what a certain dice notation means, you can ask your other team mates or the Quest Master - one of them will surely know!\\n\\nQuestguard is a \\"d12 system\\", unlike Dungeons and Dragons and Pathfinder, which are \\"d20 systems\\". This simply means that you will use the d12 die for _a lot_ of things in Questguard. The 12-sided die will be your best friend while playing Questguard, so learn which one it is! Frankly, we believe it is also the prettiest die of them all! Just look at that perfect shape... beautiful!\\n","How does it play out?":"Here is how a standard game session plays out:\\nWhen everyone sits down at the table and is ready to start playing, the Quest Master will start telling you how the story begins. This is usually narration in the 2nd person, addressing you all at the same time.\\n\\"You are all sitting around a camp fire, deep in the woods. It is a cool Autumn day and the sky is clear of clouds. You are surrounded by thick shrubbery and your shadows dance as the flame flickers\\".\\nYou and your fellow players can choose to do, well, anything, at any point during the story. However, you should refrain from interrupting the Quest Master while they are talking. Generally, you can ask the Quest Master for any more information you think you need, and the Quest Master might or might not tell you, depending on the story they are telling.\\nHowever, a clear sign that you _can_ do something is if the Quest Master says \\"what do you do?\\". That is your time to shine as a team.\\n\\"Suddenly, a bear appears out of the thicket. What do you do?\\"\\nAnd there is no correct answer. You, together, as a team, decide what you want to do. Do you want to scare off the bear? Do you run? Do you hide? Do you want to shoot an arrow at it? Do you want to cast a magic spell at it and set it on fire? Do you want to do... nothing? Of course, each of you can do something different if you have different opinions on what the best course of action is, but, fundamentally, you are all in this together.\\nIf you want to do something, simply say it out loud! \\"I want to hide from the bear\\" or, more directly, \\"I hide from the bear\\" (generally, when a player says \\"I\\" or \\"Me\\", they refer to their character; if you don\'t feel comfortable using \\"I\\", use \\"my character\\", like \\"My character wants to hide\\" or \\"I want my character to hide\\"). Or, you could ask the Quest Master clarification questions like \\"Does my character know the bear\'s intentions?\\" or \\"Do I see other bears in the darkness?\\". Situations might hide secrets!\\nThis repeats on and on: the Quest Master describes a situation, and you all decide how to resolve that situation. Usually, the Quest Master has prepared in advance your possibilities, but, a lot of the time, the Quest Master\'s job is to improvise and know how to deal with whatever the players decide they want to do. Being a good QM takes a lot of practice and time invested, but it is worth it!\\n\\nNormally, there is no \\"turn order\\" in which players do things. Anyone can do anything at any point in time. Nonetheless, the QM might impose an order in which each player can say what they want to do, to keep everything organized.\\nHowever, there _is_ a turn order when it comes to fighting! If the players engage in a battle to the death, there will be an order in which everyone can say what they want to do! But more on that later.\\nFor now, we\'re concerned with this bear that\'s appeared near our campfire.\\n\\nYou want to _do something_. Will you succeed?\\n","Checks":"So, you want to _do something. How do you determine if your character succeeds or fails at it?\\nWhenever you (your character) want to do something that requires some effort, that will usually require you to make roll Check.\\nA Check is a d12 die roll - you roll a 12-sided die to determine how well you do. If you get a 1, 2 or 3, that is usually pretty bad, while 10, 11 or 12 are pretty good numbers and have a higher chance to succeed.\\nYou as the player don\'t know how high you have to roll to succeed - the Quest Master knows it, though, and you must trust that they are playing it fairly.\\nWhether you fail or succeed, the Quest Master will let you know what happens! The QM might say \\"You try to hide behind a tree, but the bear\'s keen sense of smell detects where you are\\" if you fail, or \\"You successfully hide behind a tree, without the bear noticing\\" if you succeed.\\nWhenever not sure what you can do, ask the QM!\\n\\nHowever, how well you do is not all completely random. Naturally, a short, skinny Gnome should be better at hiding than most, and a bulky barbarian should normally be better at lifting heavy objects than most.\\nThat is where your character\'s stats come in!\\n","Stats":"Each Character\'s has 5 Stats: Might, Dexterity, Intelligence, Sense and Charisma.\\nTogether, they represent your Character\'s capabilities. When you create your character, each of them will range from -1 to 3, but they are generally balanced so you have some higher Stats and some lower Stats.\\nStats are just some numbers that represent how good your character is at that particular thing. Having -1 in a Stat means you are below average at that (yikes!), having 0 or 1 in a Stat means you (your character) are average and having 2 or 3 means you are above average or great at it!\\n\\nMight refers to how physically strong the character is and how much physical effort and pain the character can endure. If you have 0 Might, it means your character is pretty average at physical strength.\\nDexterity refers to how agile the character is, how good its reflexes are, how well it can maintain balance, etc. If you have 3 Dexterity, you are _really_ agile, and really good at those things!\\nIntelligence refers to how many things the character knows, how well it does with magic and how good their memory is. If you have -1 Intelligence, it means the character is (no offense) fairly dumb.\\nSense refers to how good your 5 senses are, how strong your willpower is, and how keen your intuition is.\\nA 1 in Sense means you have average senses and willpower.\\nCharimsa refers to how well you do in social situations, both verbally and with body language. A 2 in Charisma means you are a good communicator and people usually like you!\\n","Checks Continued":"Let\'s get back to Checks. Whenever you make a Check, you add one of the appropriate Stats to the d12 roll.\\nSo, if you want to hide, that fits with the Dexterity Stat, so you roll a d12 and add your Dexterity to that. If you are the short, skinny and sneaky Gnome and your Dexterity is 3, you roll a d12 and add 3 to the result. That is the result of your Check.\\nThe Quest Master will usually tell you what Stat to use for a certain Check.\\n\\nOnly the Quest Master knows how high the result of your Check has to be to succeed, but, as a general rule of thumb, most medium to difficult tasks will require you to get at least a 10 (with the d12 + the Stat).\\n\\nThose are all the rules for regular Checks! But if you are a maths-savy person, you will notice that even if you have the highest number in a Stat, that is still only a 50% chance to succeed. So, to combat this, there are plenty of special Abilities that allow you to add more numbers to Checks - in some special cases, you can get even up to +15 to Checks!\\nDon\'t worry about it for now. Questguard is very straight-forward. If you can add more numbers to a Check, you will see it explicitly written on something your Character can do.\\nBut there are no other general rules for Checks. Unless you see an exception explicitly written on your Character\'s sheet, that\'s all you need to know for Checks!\\n","Combat":"If you decide to engage in combat (or the enemies ambush you), the way things play out change slightly.\\nTactical combat is a large part of what makes Questguard unique and an improvement over other systems.\\nIn combat, you can no longer make decisions whever you want, but you have to take them on your turn. Combat in all RPG\'s play more similarly to a board game in which you have more freedom.\\nFirst things first, let\'s talk about the turn order.\\n","Turn order (and Initiative)":"Turn order is determined by rolling a d12 and taking turns in order from the highest to the lowest.\\n\\nLet\'s say you are 4 players, and are ambushed by 3 bears. You can\'t just say \\"I shoot an arrow at the bear\\" and do it immediately. You must respect the turn order, because maybe the bears are faster than you!\\nBut how do you determine the order in which everyone acts? By rolling a d12, of course!\\n\\nTo determine combat turn order, every player rolls for \\"Initiative\\", meaning you roll a d12 and add your Dexterity and your Charisma to the roll.\\nSince your Dexterity is 3 and your Charisma is 2 (as the short sneaky Gnome that you are), that means you roll a d12 and add 5 to the result. That\'s pretty good!\\n\\nEveryone takes their turn in order of how high they rolled. Whoever rolled the highest goes first.\\nIn Questguard, monsters and non-placed characters don\'t roll for Initiative, but instead just have a number. Bears, for example, have 10 Initiative by default.\\n\\nSo, if you roll above 10, you go before the bears.\\nSince bears all have the same initiative, they take their turns one by one, one after another (or, if the QM decides so, they could take their turns all at the same time).\\n\\nAfter everyone rolls for Initiative, it\'s time to fight (in order of initiative).\\nEveryone (and the bears) take turns to do what they want to do, and then again and again until combat is over (AKA all enemis die, all players die, you run away, you negotiate a truce, etc).\\n","Ambushing":"Sometimes, one or multiple Units will sneak upon another group to try to ambush them.\\nWhen a Unit is ambushing, the combat starts; everyone rolls Initiative, but the ambushing Unit(s) hax maximum initiative. Everyone else follows the normal rules for Initiative.\\n\\nApply common sense when someone is Ambushing. For example, if a Rogue makes a Dexterity Check to stealthily get close to the enemies and succeeds, they might be able to say \\"I want to attack them!\\". Then the combat starts and the Rogue goes first.\\nAmbushing can also happen when the enemies do not expect an attack (e.g. you are talking calmly to an NPC and suddenly attack it).\\nNote that if the enemies are prepared or expecting an attack, then it\'s not am ambush anymore. If you suddenly decide to attack an NPC you are talking to, use normal Initiative rules.\\nSometimes it\'s tricky to tell if it\'s an ambush or not - it is up to the QM to determine if something counts as an ambush.\\n","Health":"How much you can resist in combat is determined by your Health Points. Every living thing in the game has Health Point (or just Health, or HP).\\nYou as a character have a set amount of Health Points determined by how you created your character.\\n\\nWhenever you take Damage, you subtract that many points from your current Health Points.\\nIf someone reaches 0 or less Health Points, they die (or at least fall incapacitated).\\nProtect these Health Points as best you can, because they represent your life!\\n\\nAs the sneaky Gnome you are, let\'s say you have a total of 12 Health Points.\\nDuring your day of adventuring, you will undoubtedly fight enemies, fall in traps and hurt yourself.\\nWhenever that happens, you will lose some of your Health Points.\\n\\nYou regain all of your lost Health Points back when your character takes an 8-hour break from adventuring in-game, in a safe environment; this is called a Long Rest.\\nLong Rests have nothing to do with real world time. You can just say \\"Let\'s take a Long Rest\\" and the Quest Master might just say \\"Done, 8 hours have passed\\".\\nTake note that you can not Long Rest while camping in a forest, in a dungeon, wilderness, etc!\\n\\nDuring the gaming session, you will have to keep track yourself of how many Health Points you have, either on a sheet of paper or in a document. Don\'t cheat!\\nYour total amount of Health is calculated when you create your character; we\'ll get into that a bit later.\\n","Your Turn":"When it\'s your turn in combat, you can A) Move and B) use your Action (in any order).\\nEveryone can take an Action in combat and Move. Let\'s begin with moving.\\n","Moving":"When you decide to move, you can run a few meters in any direction, spending on your Speed.\\nAs a Gnome, your Speed is 4 meters per turn (the Speed of all Gnomes is 4 meters per turn). That means you can run 4 meters once per turn.\\n4 meters is just the maximum number of total meters you can move. You can move 2 meters up and 2 meters to the left, or move only 3 meters in any direction, or not move at all! It\'s up to you how you move.\\n","Actions":"Player Characters can all make one Action on their turn. This can mean attacking, casting a magic Spell, or anything you can think of that uses your hands (usually).\\n\\nThe most standard way to take your turn is to move once and then attack once (or attack and then move).\\nIf you want to do something that uses both hands, that\'s an Action.\\nBut what if you want to do something different with each hand? That\'s where Half-Actions come in.\\n","Half-Actions":"Half-Actions are exactly what they sound like: using only one hand to do something is a Half-Action, and using both hands to do something is an Action.\\nEssentially, on your turn, you can make 2 Half-Actions (which is the same as an Action).\\nAny Action is just two Half-Actions combined. You want to attack with a 2-Handed Swords? That\'s 1 Action, AKA 2 Half-Actions. You use both your hands for this, and since one hand means one Half-Action, that\'s simply the same as one Action.\\nThe term \\"Action\\" is just another word for \\"two Half-Actions\\".\\n\\nIf you choose to do so, you can even make a Half-Action with one hand, move 4 meters, then make another Half-Action.\\n\\nBut it gets better! You don\'t actually need to keep track of which hand you used already! It doesn\'t matter you already used your right hand to make a Half-Action.\\nOn your turn, you have 2 Half-Actions. Period. They are not tied to one hand or the other in particular. You want to make 2 Half-Actions with the same hand? You are free to do so!\\nIf you have a shield and a 1-Handed Sword, yes, you can make 2 attacks with the same hand with the same sword. But don\'t worry about the numbers; the game is balanced around this.\\n\\nIn the future, when your character becomes more advanced, some Abilities will give you more Actions per turn! If you have a total of 2 Actions on your turn, that\'s exactly like having 4 Half-Actions. And you\'d be able to make 4 attacks with the same hand and weapon, or one attack with a 2-Handed Weapon and 2 attacks with 1-Handed Weapon. You\'re free to do whatever you want with your hands!\\n","Attacking, Weapons and Defense":"When you attack with a weapon, you roll the weapon\'s dice and subtract the enemy\'s Defense.\\n\\nEvery weapon in the game does a certain amount of Damage and all weapons can be found on the Weapons page.\\nEvery weapon also benefits from either your Might or your Dexterity.\\nFor example, a Club deals 1d10 Damage and uses the Might Stat. So, whenever you attack with the Club, the Damage done by that attack is 1d8 + your Might. If you are the sneaky, slim Gnome, that means 1d8 - 1, which is not very good.\\nThe Whip, however, deals 1d4 + 3 Damage and uses Dexterity. Thus, if you are the sneaky Gnome, the Damage will be 1d4 + 6, which is much better!\\n\\nYou roll the Damage, and the enemy subtracts the Damage you deal from their Health Points. Your job is to get them to 0 or less Health.\\n\\nHowever, every character and monster has another number called Defense. Whenever it is attacked, their Defense reduces the amount of Damage they take by that amount.\\nFor example, if you attack the Bear and the attack would deal 7 Damage, the Bear does not just lose 7 Health, but instead subtracts its Defense from the attack.\\nBears\' Defense is 4, so, whevener the Bear is attacked, it reduces all incoming Damage by 4. 7 becomes 3. That\'s the final amount of Damage the Bear takes.\\n\\nTo conclude, the final Damage of your attack is: (Weapon Damage) + (your Might or Dexterity) - (enemy Defense).\\nIn this particular case with you being the Gnome and the enemy being the Bear, the total Damage is (1d6 + 1) + (3) - (4).\\n\\nNo matter if you use a 1-Handed Weapon (with Half-Actions) or a 2-Handed Weapon (with Actions), the formula is the same. Even if you use both hands, the formula doesn\'t change. It\'s always the same.\\n\\nRemember the magic formula for attacking: Weapon + Stat - Defense.\\n\\nThat\'s pretty much it for attacking! The next section will go a bit more into detail about some other tips and tricks for combat!\\n","Regaining Health":"Inherit Health Regen from Rules","Why Your Positioning Matters":"While on paper combat seems like a randomness fest, there are many other things that influence combat.\\nOne of the most important is positioning. If you shoot an arrow at an enemy behind a wall, it will obviously not be as efficient as if the enemy was standing in an open field.\\nIf you fall from above onto an enemy, that\'s more effective than just attacking normally.\\nThere is even a bonus for doing a cool stunt!\\n\\nDuring combat, there are all sorts of extra small bonuses or minuses you can get on your attacks, depending on how well you are positioned.\\nDon\'t bother with memorizing them for now. The Quest Master will tell you when the time comes. Just remember positioning matters. If it makes sense that you ever get a penalty to an attack, you probably do. Ask the Quest Master.\\nIf you want to see all of these penalties and bonuses, you can check the Attack Bonuses and Penalties page.\\n","Abilities":"An Ability is simply a block of text that either gives you some thing extra (passively) or gives you something else to do with your Actions rather than attacking.\\nEvery Race and Class gives you some special Abilities. You will know you have these Abilities if they are written on your character sheet.\\nIf you are a Gnome, you have some extra Abilities that Elves don\'t have.\\n\\nLet\'s take a look at exactly what Abilities you start with as a Gnome!\\n\\nFirst off, you have Inherited Tastes. You can see it\'s a Passive Ability, meaning you don\'t need to use it manually; it\'s always there, in the back of your mind. It\'s like an extra trait for your character.\\nInherited Tastes is very simple. You don\'t have a sense of taste, but your eyes perceive colors sharper than most. Doesn\'t sound like much, but it is an Ability!\\n\\nThen, let\'s look at Lucky Presence. This one is an Ability that you can actually use!\\nAfter someone else makes a Check, you can say \\"I use Lucky Presence\\" and they must roll the check again. Presumably, you would use this on your allies when they fail a Check, or on your enemies when they succeed a Check you would\'ve liked them to fail.\\nThere are 2 interesting things about this Ability: the first one is that it\'s a \\"Reaction\\". Reaction is another type of Action that you can only do on others\' turns. You can\'t do just anything with Reactions. Every Reaction is usually an Ability that has a specific time when you can use it. In this case, you must use Lucky Presence when someone makes a Check.\\nThe second thing to look at is the hourglass icon near which it says \\"Long Rest\\". This is called a Cooldown and it tells you how long you have to wait before you can use this Ability again after you use it once. If it has a Cooldown of Long Rest, that means you can use it once, and then you must finish a Long Rest before you can use it again.\\n\\nThat\'s all the Abilities Gnomes start with! Let\'s take a look at another Ability now, to see another example. We\'ll look at the Spell called Bonfire.\\nBonfire is a magical Spell, and it is only available to spell casters, like Mages and Shamans. When you cast this, you choose 1-cubic-meter area where a bonfire is conjured, and it deals Damage! The Aability text itself is self explanatory and straight-forward.\\nBonfire takes 1 Action to do. So, on your turn, you\'d have to choose between attacking and casting Bonfire. Reminder that 1 Action is the same as 2 Half-Actions. So if you cast Bonfire, you can not do anything else with your hands this turn! And if you use one hand for a Half-Action, you can\'t cast Bonfire; because you are left with a Half-Action, and Bonfire takes 1 whole Action.\\nThe last thing to notice about Bonfire is the arrow-and-target icon where it says \\"6 meters\\". This simply means the spell Bonfire has a maximum range of 6 meters. The space you choose to cast Bonfire on must be within 6 meters of you (and you must be able to see the location, of course).\\n\\nOne quick way to differentiate Passive from Active Abilities is that Active Abilities have a square icon, while Passive Abilities have a round icon!\\n\\nLet\'s look into an Ability that\'s a little more _Advanced_, Healing Surge.\\nThe text is very short and straight-forward - you restore 2d6 Health to a Unit. \\nThe \\"Half-Action\\" and \\"5 meters\\" tags should also be self explanatory for you by now.\\nThe \\"1 Mana\\" text refers to the cost of this Ability. The next section will explain Spellcasting.\\n  \\n","Abilities Notes":"Generally, you will have to find a way to keep track of your Abilities. Sure, you can just write down the name of each Ability you have, but then you\'d have to search it online every time you want to do something. The easiest way to keep track is with the Ability Sheet Generator, which can be found at this link.\\n","Spellcasting":"You will see the word Spell - all Spells are Abilities. A Spell is just a normal Ability, but it\'s magical by nature.\\n","Mana Spellcasting":"All classes in the game use a system of points called Mana Points.\\nYou have a number of Mana Points that you can spend to cast some Spells, and you regain all Mana Points back when you finish a Long Rest (8 in-game hours of non-adventuring and resting in a safe environment, like a tavern).\\n\\nFor a clear example, let\'s take a look at the Mage Class. As written on the Mage rules page, Mages start with 3 Mana Points. The Mage can choose to spend these points on casting Spells.\\nEach Spell specifies if and how many Mana Points it costs to cast. If you decide to cast Healing Surge, you must expend one Mana Point and then you are left with 2 Mana Points. It doesn\'t specify that Healing Surge has a Cooldown, so you can do it even twice per turn (since it takes a Half-Action) as long as you have enough Mana Points. If you don\'t have enough Mana Points to cast a Spell, you simply can\'t.\\n\\nWhen building your character, you will have to choose a number of Spells from a given list - you can\'t have them all, there are dozens in the game! You\'ll pick a few Spells to have at hand. Mages, for example, start out with 4 + your Intelligence Spells. So, if your Intelligence is 3, you must pick 7 out of all the Spells Mages can choose from. These will be all the Spells you will be able to Cast until you finish your next Long Rest (8 in-game hours of non-adventuring and resting in a safe environment, like a tavern).\\nThis is explained in further detail later on, at Character Creation.\\n\\nYou can keep track of your Mana Points on a sheet of paper, with marbles, dice, etc. It is your job to keep track of your Mana Points. Don\'t cheat!\\n","Cooldown-based Spellcasting":"DEPRECATED","Wrapping up the basics":"Those are all the basics of the game! You can now play the game with your group!\\nAs mentioned several times, don\'t bother with remembering _everything_. It\'s merely good to have a general overview of how the game works before you get into it. It is always recommended you find a group where at least one person has experience playing any tabletop RPG, be it Pathfinder, Dungeons and Dragons or Questguard. And if they have player D&D or Pathfinder but they are new to CoH, send them the D&D Transition Guide! It\'s a guide specifically for D&D players who want to learn Questguard and explains all the differences and changes.\\n","Character Creation":"Building a character is one of the most fun aspects of the game and provides you with a way to express what kind of person you want to be in the adventure. While some adventures come with premade characters (like Don, the sneaky Gnome you were assigned in the previous sections of this guide), most games will have you make your own character.\\nThis section will guide you through all the steps for building a new character.\\n","Rest of Character Creation":"Inherit everything from CharacterCreation"}'),fw=JSON.parse('{"A. Intro to Questguard":{"Basics of Questguard RPG":{"Welcome!":"Well met, adventurer! ..., you are in the right place! In this guide you will find all about roleplaying and Questguard - how to create a character, how to play the game, a glossary of all rules and a section with several tips for Quest Masters.","Groups (and our community)":"If you want to play, sometimes it\'s as easy as creating a character outside of a game, finding a group to play with via an online platform and just joining the game.\\nHowever, tabletop RPG\'s can be so much more than just a one-time experience!\\n\\nMany QM\'s choose to run \'campaigns\', which is a series of game sessions that continue from one play session to another, and expand into an overarching story and develop the players\' characters\' personalities and powers.\\nThus, if you want it to be a more intricate experience, you should find a group that fits you; make sure you get on well with everyone else and everyone is on the same page when it comes to playing.\\n\\nEach QM is different. A QM might run a story based on the Lord of the Rings books or in some made up world. Some QM\'s have different styles of playing - some are more focused on telling a story, others are more focused on giving the players options. Some are friendly, some... less so.\\nUltimately, just like finding a group to play board games with, you all should have roughly the same expectations and mindset. Some games are more relaxed, drinking and eating pizza. Some are more intense and take things seriously. If you find a group, make sure you ask what kind of group they are.\\n\\nMost groups have one Quest Master and between 3 and 6 other players who play as individual characters.\\nThe recommended sweet spot for Questguard is one Quest Master and 4 to 5 other players.\\n\\nA play session can last as long as the group desires. Usually, you should dedicate at least 1:30 to 2 hours to a play session. A lot of players find they want to keep going after that, since time flies fast when you\'re having fun and making progress through the story!\\n\\nQuestguard has a dedicated community on Discord where we always organize new campaigns and sessions for players both new and old.\\n","Learning the rules":"Don\'t worry about learning all the rules - just build a character and get going in a session. You will find a lot of rules intuitive and catch most of them while you play!\\nIt might be daunting to learn all the rules by yourself. But fret not; since Questguard is mainly inspired by Dungeons and Dragons, you fill find a lot of people who play D&D and will be willing to try CoH with you!\\nThe easiest way to get started is to find someone who already knows how to play Questguard and ask to join their game, or ask them to host a game for you and some other friends.\\nIf you want to try Questguard specifically and you have experience with Dungeons and Dragons (5th edition or One D&D), see the page \\"D&D to CoH transition guide\\". It will provide you an easy introduction to Questguard from a D&D perspective.\\nIf you never played a tabletop RPG but you have friends who have played Dungeons and Dragons, send them a link to the \\"D&D to CoH transition guide\\" page!\\nIf you decide to play online, there are several platforms for playing Questguard that simulate real life tables with miniatures, dice, music, etc. As of 2023, the most popular such platform is Roll20 (https://roll20.net). It is free for all players and Quest Masters alike and supports many roleplaying games, including Questguard.\\n","Using this guide":"In this guide, there are 5 sections: Questguard for Beginners, explaining the basics of roleplaying and how Questguard is different from other games, Character Creation, explaining how to create a character, step by step. Playing the Game, explaining what you can do on sessions and on your turn in combat. Core Rules (In-Depth) is a glossary of all rules of the game, in-depth, with specific circumstances and situations and disambiguations.

Whatever you want to do, it is likely you will need to roll a die for it to determine if you succeed or fail, either as a Player Character or as an NPC or monster.\\nIn the world of tabletop roleplaying, there exists one standard set of \\"polyhedral\\" dice - whether they are Dungeons and Dragons dice or Pathfinder dice, they are all the same and they all work.\\nA set of such dice contains 7 special dice: a 4-sided die, a 6-sided die, an 8-sided die, two 10-sided dice, a 12-sided die and a 20-sided die. Only one such set will suffice for playing Questguard to its full extent, though the more dice you have, the merrier!\\nEach of these dice contains one number on each face: the 4-sided die goes from 1 to 4, the 6-sided die (normal die) goes from 1 to 6, and so on.\\nWherever you live, you can buy a set of roleplaying dice for less than $10 (as of 2023), usually at a board game shop or a gaming store, or, if you can\'t find any, you can order them online. If you can\'t afford that, there are plenty of mobile dice simulators. Just search \\"dice\\" on your mobile application store and there should be several free applications that mimick dice rolling!\\nIf you decide to play online and not at a real table, however, you don\'t need to buy dice and can just use online dice rolling simulators. There are many platforms for online roleplaying and they all incorporate dice rolling simulators.                \\n","Dice notations":"Whenever you see a notation like \\"d4\\", \\"d6\\", \\"d8\\", etc, these mean \\"4-sided die\\", \\"6-sided die\\", \\"8-sided die\\", etc.\\nSo, a die with 4 sides is called a \\"d4\\", a die with 6 sides is called a \\"d6\\", etc. \\nIf you see \\"d4\\", that means you\'re supposed to roll a 4-sided die and take that result.\\nIf you see \\"d6\\", that means you\'re supposed to roll a 6-sided die and take that result. And so on and so forth.\\n\\nIf you are ever in doubt about what a certain dice notation means, you can ask your other team mates or the Quest Master - one of them will surely know!\\n\\nQuestguard is a \\"d12 system\\", unlike Dungeons and Dragons and Pathfinder, which are \\"d20 systems\\". This simply means that you will use the d12 die for _a lot_ of things in Questguard. The 12-sided die will be your best friend while playing Questguard, so learn which one it is! Frankly, we believe it is also the prettiest die of them all! Just look at that perfect shape... beautiful!\\n","Dice calculations":"When you see notation like \\"1d6 + 1d8\\", that simply means you roll a d6 and a d8, and you add the results together for the final result.\\nNaturall, 1d6 + 4, for example, means you roll a d6 and add 4 to the result.\\n"},"Gameplay Phases":{"Free Roleplay":"Questguard is separated into 2 types of gameplay: free roleplay and Combat.\\nIn free roleplay, everyone is allowed to do whatever they like.\\n","Combat":"In combat, rules change a bit and we play turn-by-turn, on a grid, and we do damage.\\n"}},"B. Character Creation":{"Starting Out":{"What makes a Character":"This section explains how to quickly create your character and fill your character sheet.\\nEvery subsection of character creation will explain the related rules.\\nEvery character is a combination of a Race, a Class.\\nYou can find all the available Races under Database, Races and all Classes under Database, Classes.\\nThink of a Race and Class combination that you would like to play. You can browse them to get an idea for what they are, or you can decide based on what sounds cool to you.\\nThere is no \\"background\\", like in other games, but make sure you give your character a nice back-story!\\n","Your Race...":"Human, Elf, Bertle, etc.\\n","Your Class...":"Refers to your combat style and \\"profession\\".

Race Features":{"Race Stat Distribution":"Every Race imposes some restrictions to how you can put in your Stats. For example, if you\'re an Elf, you need at least 1 Dexterity and 1 Intelligence.\\n","Health (HP)":"Determined by your Race.","Health Regen":"This is the small box near your Health, and it\'s given by your Race, plus your Level. Inbetween Worthy combat encounters, all Player Characters in the group automatically heal for up to that amount, but only up to 3 times per Adventure, even if not damaged. You can\'t \'overheal\' and heal above your Max Health.\\n","Movement Speed":"Determined by your Race.","Languages":"You always speak Common. You might also speak other languages based on what your Race gives you. If it says you speak a number of languages equal to your Intelligence, this is at least 0 (e.g. you can\'t go negative and forget languages).\\nPut these in the Languages box, the 4th box of the 4 small boxes under Stats.\\n","Racial Abilities":"All Feats, Spells, special powers, etc in this game are called Abilities. When you see a box with a nice little icon, a name, description, etc, that\'s an Ability.\\nSome Abilities cost an Action or a Half-Action. Some cost 0 Actions, meaning you don\'t spend any actions on your turn to use them (there is no such thing as a Bonus Action).\\nSome Abilities are Passive, meaning they\'re always there and you don\'t need to specify you use them - they simply are.\\nEvery Race gives you some Abilities, listed under Abilities. You have all of them. Take note of them.\\nSome Races like Dragonsworn allow you to pick an extra Ability from their Ability Choices.\\n","Racial Ability Choice":"Every Race gets to pick one starting Ability to customize their character better.\\n"},"B. Class Features":{"Initiative":"This refers to the order in combat. When combat starts, you roll Initiative (1d12 + Initiative) and, the higher you roll, the sooner you act in combat.\\n","Weapon Training":"Every Class gives you Training in one or more weapon categories.\\nThere are 5 weapon categories, all very simple: 1-Handed Melee, 2-Handed Melee, 1-Handed Ranged, 2-Handed Ranged and Shields.\\nThink of what kind of weapons your character would use and put the Training in weapons you have in Training; it\'s one of the small 4 boxes under Stats.\\nYou will pick your actual weapon later. But, for reference, you can take a look at the Weapons under Database, Gear and Items, Weapons.\\nNote that weapon attacks use either Might or Dexterity (usually). If you want more of a spell-casting playstyle, weapons might not matter as much.\\n","Skills (Being Skilled)":"In Questguard, there isn\'t a list of set Checks with bonuses written directly on your Character Sheet.\\nInstead, there are Skills - non-combat activities your character is generally good at. A Skill is just an Ability that allows you to add your Character\'s Level to non-combat Checks (with a d12) in certain scenarios. Like Skilled in Acrobatics (bonus to all Checks that can be interpreted as \\"acrobatics\\") or Skilled in Occultism (bonus to all Checks about knowing \\"occult\\" or dark information). We call this being Skilled in a type of activity.\\n\\nA Skill (being Skilled) in an activity always gives you a bonus equal to your Character\'s Level when performing that activity. So, if you want to jump from a balcony to another and you have Skilled in Acrobatics, you make a Dexterity Check and add your Level to that Check. The final number is your result for the Check.\\n\\nHowever, Skills are often up to interpretation. For example, the Quest Master might ask you for a general Sense Check to see if you can spot the spy, and it is up to you to mention you are Skilled in something that would help you. Try to come up with a reason why your Skill can be applied in this situation!\\n\\nEvery Class gives you certain Skills and lets you also pick a number of them, depending on your Intelligence.\\nYou can find a list of Skills under Database, {Proficiencies}, All. If you want to be Skilled in something and it\'s not there, you\'re free to make it up, but it must be approved by the Quest Master.\\n","Class Abilities":"You get all of these Abilities.\\nTake note of them on your Character Sheet (e.g. in Description).\\n","Mana":"Mana is a resource you will use to use some Abilities.

Playing the Game":{"Free Roleplaying":{"Checks":"So, you want to do something. How do you determine if your character succeeds or fails at it?\\nWhenever you (your character) want to do something that requires some effort, that will usually require you to make roll Check.\\nA Check is a d12 die roll - you roll a 12-sided die to determine how well you do. If you get a 1, 2 or 3, that is usually pretty bad, while 10, 11 or 12 are pretty good numbers and have a higher chance to succeed.\\nYou as the player don\'t know how high you have to roll to succeed - the Quest Master knows it, though, and you must trust that they are playing it fairly.\\nWhether you fail or succeed, the Quest Master will let you know what happens! The QM might say \\"You try to hide behind a tree, but the bear\'s keen sense of smell detects where you are\\" if you fail, or \\"You successfully hide behind a tree, without the bear noticing\\" if you succeed.\\nWhenever not sure what you can do, ask the QM!\\n\\nHowever, how well you do is not all completely random. Naturally, a short, skinny Gnome should be better at hiding than most, and a bulky barbarian should normally be better at lifting heavy objects than most.\\nThat is where your character\'s stats come in!\\n","Social Etiquette":"Be nice and don\'t interrupt others; try to make decisions as a team.\\n"},"Combat":{"My turn":"If you decide to engage in combat (or the enemies ambush you), the way things play out change slightly.\\nTactical combat is a large part of what makes Questguard unique and an improvement over other systems.\\nIn combat, you can no longer make decisions whever you want, but you have to take them on your turn. Combat in all RPG\'s play more similarly to a board game in which you have more freedom.\\nFirst things first, let\'s talk about the turn order.\\n","My Actions":"Player Characters can all make one Action on their turn. This can mean attacking, casting a magic Spell, or anything you can think of that uses your hands (usually).\\n\\nThe most standard way to take your turn is to move once and then attack once (or attack and then move).\\nIf you want to do something that uses both hands, that\'s an Action.\\nBut what if you want to do something different with each hand? That\'s where Half-Actions come in.\\n\\nHalf-Actions are exactly what they sound like: using only one hand to do something is a Half-Action, and using both hands to do something is an Action.\\nEssentially, on your turn, you can make 2 Half-Actions (which is the same as an Action).\\nAny Action is just two Half-Actions combined. You want to attack with a 2-Handed Swords? That\'s 1 Action, AKA 2 Half-Actions. You use both your hands for this, and since one hand means one Half-Action, that\'s simply the same as one Action.\\nThe term \\"Action\\" is just another word for \\"two Half-Actions\\".\\n\\nIf you choose to do so, you can even make a Half-Action with one hand, move 4 meters, then make another Half-Action.\\n\\nBut it gets better! You don\'t actually need to keep track of which hand you used already! It doesn\'t matter you already used your right hand to make a Half-Action.\\nOn your turn, you have 2 Half-Actions. Period. They are not tied to one hand or the other in particular. You want to make 2 Half-Actions with the same hand? You are free to do so!\\nIf you have a shield and a 1-Handed Sword, yes, you can make 2 attacks with the same hand with the same sword. But don\'t worry about the numbers; the game is balanced around this.\\n\\nIn the future, when your character becomes more advanced, some Abilities will give you more Actions per turn! If you have a total of 2 Actions on your turn, that\'s exactly like having 4 Half-Actions. And you\'d be able to make 4 attacks with the same hand and weapon, or one attack with a 2-Handed Weapon and 2 attacks with 1-Handed Weapon. You\'re free to do whatever you want with your hands!\\n\\nWhen you attack with a weapon, you roll the weapon\'s dice and subtract the enemy\'s Defense.\\n\\nEvery weapon in the game does a certain amount of Damage and all weapons can be found on the Weapons page.\\nEvery weapon also benefits from either your Might or your Dexterity.\\nFor example, a Club deals 1d10 Damage and uses the Might Stat. So, whenever you attack with the Club, the Damage done by that attack is 1d8 + your Might. If you are the sneaky, slim Gnome, that means 1d8 - 1, which is not very good.\\nThe Whip, however, deals 1d4 + 3 Damage and uses Dexterity. Thus, if you are the sneaky Gnome, the Damage will be 1d4 + 6, which is much better!\\n\\nYou roll the Damage, and the enemy subtracts the Damage you deal from their Health Points. Your job is to get them to 0 or less Health.\\n\\nHowever, every character and monster has another number called Defense. Whenever it is attacked, their Defense reduces the amount of Damage they take by that amount.\\nFor example, if you attack the Bear and the attack would deal 7 Damage, the Bear does not just lose 7 Health, but instead subtracts its Defense from the attack.\\nBears\' Defense is 4, so, whevener the Bear is attacked, it reduces all incoming Damage by 4. 7 becomes 3. That\'s the final amount of Damage the Bear takes.\\n\\nTo conclude, the final Damage of your attack is: (Weapon Damage) + (your Might or Dexterity).\\nIn this particular case with you being the Gnome and the enemy being the Bear, the total Damage is (1d6 + 1) + (3) - (4).\\n\\nNo matter if you use a 1-Handed Weapon (with Half-Actions) or a 2-Handed Weapon (with Actions), the formula is the same. Even if you use both hands, the formula doesn\'t change. It\'s always the same.\\n","My Health and Mana":"How much you can resist in combat is determined by your Health Points. Every living thing in the game has Health Point (or just Health, or HP).\\nYou as a character have a set amount of Health Points determined by how you created your character.\\n\\nWhenever you take Damage, you subtract that many points from your current Health Points.\\nIf someone reaches 0 or less Health Points, they die (or at least fall incapacitated).\\nProtect these Health Points as best you can, because they represent your life!\\n\\nAs the sneaky Gnome you are, let\'s say you have a total of 12 Health Points.\\nDuring your day of adventuring, you will undoubtedly fight enemies, fall in traps and hurt yourself.\\nWhenever that happens, you will lose some of your Health Points.\\n\\nYou regain all of your lost Health Points back when your character takes an 8-hour break from adventuring in-game, in a safe environment; this is called a Long Rest.\\nLong Rests have nothing to do with real world time. You can just say \\"Let\'s take a Long Rest\\" and the Quest Master might just say \\"Done, 8 hours have passed\\".\\nTake note that you can not Long Rest while camping in a forest, in a dungeon, wilderness, etc!\\n\\nDuring the gaming session, you will have to keep track yourself of how many Health Points you have, either on a sheet of paper or in a document. Don\'t cheat!\\nYour total amount of Health is calculated when you create your character; we\'ll get into that a bit later.\\n"}},"D.

You can move before or after attacking or casting a spell or doing any action, but once you move once, that\'s it! You can\'t move again until next turn! For example, you can\'t move 2 meters, take an Action (even if it\'s 0 Actions) and then move again.\\nNote that you can freely switch direction while moving, if it\'s in the same movement. If you want, you can move in one direction for a few meters, do a 180 degree turn and move back. That is valid movement, because it doesn\'t divide the movement around Actions, but it\'s still the same movement.\\n\\nHowever, there are several ways to break this rule. There are plenty of Abilities that allow you to \\"continue your movement\\".\\nAnother way to circumvent this is to get the Attack-Move Feat, which allows you to make Melee Attacks and cast non-offensive Spells \\"while moving\\".\\n","Breaking Movement":"Move, Act then Move is Breaking movement. You can\'t normally Break Movement.","Pushing":"Some Abilities \\"push\\" or \\"pull\\" Units (pulling is just pushing in the opposite direction).\\nPushing a Unit does not consume that Unit\'s movement.\\nPushing a Unit does not count as movement for that Unit (for the sake of \\"continuing movement\\").\\n","Other Movement":"Jumping takes away from Movement meters, whether vertical or horizontal.\\nSo, if you decide to jump 1 meter ahead, this still takes 1 meter of movement, as it normally would (the QM might make you roll a Check for succeeding the jump, though).\\nClimbing a 2 meter wall takes 2 meters out of your movement. If you are jumping both horizontally and vertically, you only use the movement for the horizontal movement (e.g. if you jump to a ledge 1 meter away that\'s 1 meter tall, this only uses 1 meter; similarly, if you are jumping to a ledge 3 meters away that\'s 2 meters tall, this takes only 3 meters out of your movement).\\n\\nIn some situations, Medium or Smaller Units might be able to fit through some squares of a certain Large or Large Unit (with QM\'s permission).

A hostile Unit is considered an Enemy.\\nInanimate Unit objects are considered neither Allies, nor Enemies.\\n","Worthy Enemy (Worthiness)":"Certain Abilities specify that they only work against \\"Worthy Enemies\\".\\nA Worthy Enemy is a normal enemy that tries to kill you during a combat encounter only.\\nThe following are NOT considered worthy enemies:\\n- Defenseless Units (e.g. civillians, hunted deer, etc)\\n- Units that don\'t attack or don\'t want to attack\\n- Units killed in \\"time-skip combats\\" (quick combat, e.g. combats that happen without rolling initiative, or during roleplaying, etc)\\n- Every single creature in a swarm (e.g. a single bat is not a worthy enemy, but a Bat Swarm is a worthy enemy alltogether)\\n","Unit Sizes":"Medium and smaller Units occupy a 1x1 meter space.\\nLarge Units occupy a 2x2 meter space. It is up to the QM to tell how much space a Unit larger than Large occupies, and how well it can fit through gaps and units.\\nWhen moving a Large Unit (or larger), count the number of meters it moved from the center of its starting space to the center of its end space.\\n\\nIn some situations, Medium or Smaller Units might be able to fit through some squares of a certain Large or Large Unit (with QM\'s permission).

Apply common sense to whether a mounted Unit can attack its rider (or whether the rider has Cover).\\n"},"Damage & Status":{"Attack":"An Attack is something that deals Damage or Crowd Control, coming directly from a Unit through a missile, weapon or direct Spell. Delayed Damage sources are not considered Attacks.\\nFlamebolt is an attack. Magic Missile counts as multiple attacks. Curse of Pain\'s Damage is not an attack.\\nThe term \\"Attack\\" is relevant for some Abilities.\\nThe term \\"attack\\" is also sometimes used to simply refer to the Act of hitting or striking a Unit (e.g. making a melee attack). A \\"weapon attack\\" is simply the Act of attacking with a weapon.\\n","Damage and Types":"Damage is a word for how many Health Points an attack or effect will reduce. Dealing 3 Damage to a Unit with 10 Health will leave the Unit at 7 Health. Upon reaching 0 or less Health, a Unit dies or Falls (see Death and being Fallen).\\nThere are multiple \\"types\\" of Damage, but this is just a classification for certain Abilities, and usually 3 Damage is 3 Damage, no matter the type.\\nThe Damage types are Slash, Smash, Pierce, Pulse (e.g. pressure, being flung around, etc), Fire, Cold, Shock, Scourge, Divine, Psychic, and True.\\nThere are Passive Abilities (\\"Resistances\\") that reduce certain Damage types you take by 50%, or increase it by 50% (\\"Weaknesses\\").\\nTrue Damage that can\'t be reduced by any means and is not reduced by Shielding (ignores Shielding).\\n\\nThe order in which Damage is added or subtracted from an Attack is:\\n1. Calculate all simple (non-percentage) penalties and additions (e.g. -2 Damage from Warrior Charge).\\n2. Calculate all percentage penalties or additions (e.g. Weakness, Resistance, other magical buffs, etc).\\n3. Calculate Defense\\n\\nFor example, let\'s say you Attack a Unit with a Handgun for 1d8 Damage and you roll 7. The enemy has 1 Defense, 50% Weakness to Pierce Damage, Cover, and you are using special Bullets that deal +1 Damage.\\nThe Damage becomes:\\n1. 7 + 1 (from Bullets) - 2 (from Cover) = 6\\n2. 6 + 50% of 6 (from Weakness) = 9\\n3. 9 - 1 (from Defense) = 8\\nThe final Damage from the Attack is 8.\\n","Range":"To calculate the range from a Unit to another Unit, simply measure the distance from that Unit\'s space\'s center to the other Unit\'s space\'s center.\\nIf one of the Units is Large or larger, measure the distance from one of its outer-most spaces to the one of the other Unit\'s outer-most spaces (e.g. for Large Units - NOT to center, but to edge).\\n\\nAn easy way to measure this, if you\'re playing on a grid, is to count the number of squares from one Unit to another. If the other Unit is in a square right next to his Unit (even diagonally), the distance is 1 meter. If there\'s an empty square between them, the distance is 2. And so on.\\n","Defense":"If a Unit has Defense, all Damage it takes is reduced by that amount (after ALL other calculations like bonuses, penalties, resistances, etc).\\n","Shielding":"Shielding is just extra \\"Health\\" on top of your normal Health. Shielding can exceed your Max Health. For example, if you have 20 Health and 5 Shielding, and you take 9 Damage, you will be left with 16 Health.\\nGenerally, Shielding last for a short time, then whatever is left of the Shielding disappears. For example, if you gain 10 Shielding which lasts for 1 minute, and you take 5 Damage, you will have 5 Shielding remaining. After 1 minute, the Shielding expires and you will have 0 Shielding.\\n\\nShielding can stack (e.g. from 2 Abilities). For example, if you use an Ability that gives you 10 Shielding and then use another Ability that gives you 5 Shielding, you wll have 15 Shielding.\\n\\nHowever, when one of the Shielding disappears, it tries to remove the full amount - if you gained 10 Shielding, you lose 10 Shielding when it expires. For example, if you gain 10 Shielding for an hour and 5 Shielding for 1 minute, then you take 8 Damage, this leaves you at 7 Shielding. Then, after 1 minute, the 5 Shielding disappears and leaves you at 2 Shielding.\\nFor another example, if you gain 5 Shielding for an hour and 10 Shielding for 1 minute, then you take 8 Damage, this leaves you at 7 Shielding; when the 10 Shielding expires, you will be left at 0 Shielding.\\nSimply put: if you gain Shielding and the Shielding expires, you lose as much Shielding as you gained. There is no \\"priority\\" for Shielding absorption - Shielding is Shielding. What you gain is what you lose when it expires.\\nYou do not lose Health when Shielding expires.\\n","Percentages":"A percentage from a roll or number is calculated from the final result, after all dice are rolled, rounded down. (e.g. 50% of 2d6 which rolled 9 is 4).\\n\\nAll percentages, no matter the source, stack additively.\\nThis means that -50% with -50% will result in 0%.\\nFor example, if your Fire attack has Cover, the target has a 50% resistance to Fire and you have a 50% increase from Warlock Blood Pact, the Damage of the attack is as follows: 100% (baseline) - 50% (Cover) - 50% (Resistance) + 50% (Blood Pact) = 50%. The final attack deals 50% of what it normally would do.\\n\\nThe final percentage is always rounded down, after all additions and calculations. For example, 9 Damage - 50% - 50% is always 0.\\n","Resistance and Weakness (50%)":"Resistances or weaknesses usually provide a -50% or +50% Damage to a certain type of Damage (e.g. Fire, Slash, etc).\\nIf you have both Resistance and Weakness to something, they cancel out (so you take 100% of the Damage, as normal).\\nIf you have Resistance or Weakness twice, nothing extra happens (e.g. even if you have 2 Resistance and one Weakness to the same thing, you still take 100% Damage).\\nNote that all percentages are calculated additively (+50% with +50% = +100%).\\n","Death":"Reducing a non-player character to 0 Health kills it immediately, unless the attacker purposefully stated that the Attack should be non-lethal. When a player character reaches 0 Health, it doesn\'t die, but becomes Fallen.\\n","Being Fallen (0 Health)":"When reaching 0 Health, a Player Character becomes Fallen.\\nWhen Fallen, you skip your turn. You are not unconscious - you can still speak, see and hear, but you can not move your body.\\nYou can not have less than 0 Health.\\n\\nWhen healed while Fallen, you get up and can do your turn, but you are Exhausted until the end of Combat.\\n\\nWhile Fallen, your Defense is 0, and if you take Damage 5 times, your character dies.\\nThen, if you are healed and get up from being Fallen, these \\"times\\" you can take Damage reset (e.g. even if you took Damage 2 times, if you get up and then Fall again, you still need to take the Damage 5 times to die).\\n\\nAlternatively, if the Quest Master decides to make the game extra risky and more deadly, the QM can rule that these Damage times carry on until the next Adventure.\\n","Rise":"When a Fallen Player Character (with 0 Health, but not dead) is healed, it Rises. It can continue to take its turns, but is Exhausted indefinitely.\\n","Exhaustion":"An Exhausted Unit is Dazed and Slowed indefinitely: it has only a Half-Action every turn and -2 Movement Speed.\\n\\nExhaustion does NOT last just 1 turn - Exhaustion from being Fallen is automatically cured 10 minutes after the end of the combat encounter.\\nOtherwise, Exhaustion is cured upon sleeping for 8 hours.\\n\\nYou can also become Exhausted if you go more than 24 hours without sleep, from overdosing on potions (e.g. if you drink more than 1 potion per hour) or from magical effects.\\n\\nSince you are already Dazed and Slowed, being Dazed or Slowed again has no effect.\\n","Melee vs Ranged":"Abilities usually specify if an attack is considered melee or ranged.\\nIf it is not specified, then any attack with a melee weapon that is not thrown is considered a melee attack, even if it has longer range (e.g. 2 meters or 3 meters even).\\nAlso, any attack with an Ability is considered melee if it has a range of 1 meter, otherwise it is considered a ranged attack. If it has a range of 2 more meters (thus is a ranged attack), the attack is still considered ranged even if done at very close range (e.g. 1 meter).\\nIn any other cases, if the the range is 1 meter, or the object is not thrown, but has a longer range than 1 meter, it is considered a melee attack.\\n\\nRanged attacks done at 1 meter range have a -2 penalty, even if they are Spells.\\n","Darkness":"Attacks on Units standing in darkness have Cover (-50% Damage).\\nYou Line of Sight in darkness is 3 meters.\\n\\nIf a Unit is standing in light (or is illumintated in some way), anyone may have Line of Sight to it (obviously).\\n\\nCertain Spells, items and fire may illuminate areas (e.g. short bursts of fire illuminate an area in 3 meters for up to 6 seconds (1 Round)). Naturally, Units can see illuminated areas even if they themselves are standing in darkness.\\nCertain Abilities may allow Units to see well in the dark up to a specified distance (and as such they have Line of Sight up to that distance, and don\'t have Cover.)\\n","Line of Sight":"If you can see a Unit directly, you have Line of Sight to it.\\n\\nTo clarify, if Unit A can see Unit B with their bare eyes, then Unit A has Line of Sight to Unit B.\\nIf Unit A can see even a little bit of the body of Unit B, then Unit A still has Line of Sight to Unit B (but attacks usually gain the Cover pentalty, which is -2).\\n\\nTo use an Ability, you need Line of Sight to the center target point of where you are casting the Ability.\\n\\nIf playing on a grid, if you have to target a point, you target the square that point is in. You can\'t normally target square intersections unless the Ability states you can.\\nIf you target a Unit, you must have Line of Sight to its square.\\n\\nThere is Line of Sight from square A to square B if you can draw a line from any corner of square A to any corner of square B without any other Unit or Obstacle crossing the line.\\nHowever, other Units\' or obstacles\' squares can _intersect_ the line you were drawing if it\'s merely tangential, and does not pass from one side of the line to the other.\\nSee the example below.\\n\\nWithout magical means, Line of Sight is always 2-way. If Unit A has LoS to Unit B, then Unit B also has LoS to Unit A (assuming they look at one another).\\nTransparent solid objects (e.g. windows) do not block Line of Sight, but obviously missiles like arrows and magic bolts can\'t go through them. Apply common sense.\\n\\nAllies do not block Line of Sight, and neither do Enemies, but attacking a target behind another Unit provides them with Cover against the attack.\\n","Cover":"An Act (attack, Spell, etc) has Cover if done \\"through\\" or over an obstacle or Unit, or Line of Sight is somewhat obstructed (fog, water, etc).\\nCover reduces the total roll (or Damage, or Healing, etc) by 50%.\\nWhether something has Cover is up to the Quest Master\'s interpretation. It is possible that a Unit has Cover from another Unit, but not necessarily viceversa (e.g. if shooting from behind a rock).\\n","Distace":"When calculating distance from point A to point B, calculate the distance from the square A is on to the square B is on like this:\\nStart from a square near A and count squares one by one (in a line or diagonally) until you get to B. You also count the square B is on for this.    \\nRemember this by thinking that if A is on the corner of B, that\'s a distance of 1 meter.            \\n","Area":"For Abilities that affect areas, the distance is calculated to the edge square of the area.\\nE.g. for a 4x4 meter area, if the range is 6 meters, there should be a path of 5 empty squares between the caster and the area.\\n\\nIf a spell targets a line, it starts from a square right in front of you and continues in a line.\\nE.g. if the line is 2 meters long, it takes the square in front of you, and the next one.\\n","Semi-Hitting (Area Abilities)":"When playing on a grid, you might sometimes position an area Ability in such way that it somewhat hits certain Units, hits half of their Spaces, or is in an awkward shape.\\nA fair warning: it is not recommended that you allow awkward area positions on the board.\\n\\nSemi-Hitting deals -2 Damage and Semi-Hit Units gain +2 to Checks made from it.\\nFor example, you could position a 3x3 meter area in the center of a 4x4 meter area; thus, the 4 squares in the middle will be fully covered by the 3x3 area, but the surrounding squares will all only be covered by a half of a square from the 3x3 area (or even a quarter).\\n\\nNote: a Large Unit takes the full effect even if only one space (1x1 meter) of its total area is hit (e.g. hitting only a square of the 4 squares of a Large Unit applies the normal effect - it is NOT a Semi-Hit).\\n","Near (Nearness)":"\'Near\' refers to all spaces within 1 meter of a Unit.\\n","Falling Damage":"Falling inflicts 1d6 True Damage for every 2 meters fallen (assuming you land on hard ground).\\nE.g. falling 3 meters deals 1d6 Damage, falling 4 meters deals 2d6 Damage, 5 meters - 2d6, 6 meters - 3d6, etc.\\nHaving someone fall on you deals the same True Damage to you as it does to the faller.\\nThe Quest Master might reduce the Damage or mitigate it depending what you land on or if you fall onto an enemy with an attack. If you\'re a Quest Master, consider halving the fall Damage if a Unit falls intentionately on another Unit to attack it.\\n","Combat & Resist Checks":"Some Abilities require you to make a \\"Check against something\\". To succeed, you need to roll a Check equal to or higher than the number you\'re rolling against. These are called Combat Checks. If you\'re battling against another Check, you need to roll higher than the enemy Check.\\nSome monster Abilities will have you make a Resist Check. These are just like normal Checks or Combat Checks. As usual, you must roll equal to or higher than the number you\'re rolling against in order to succeed.\\n"},"Crowd Control":{"Crowd Control standards":"A \\"Crowd Control\\" effect is a status effect on a Unit that prevents it from doing things normally (e.g. it can\'t move, it can\'t make Actions, can\'t take its turn, etc).\\nAll Crowd Control lasts until the end of that Unit\'s next Turn (or until the end of their current Turn if it\'s their Turn now), unless stated otherwise.\\nCrowd Controls of different types stack together (e.g. a Unit that is both Feared and Fumbling is essentially Stunned, since it can only do 1 Act due to being Feared, but whatever Act it decides to do is negated due to Fumbling).\\nCrowd Controls of the same types do NOT stack (e.g. if you make a Unit Blinded 2 times, it will still be Blinded as normal for just 1 turn, even if it is an Epic monster).\\n","Slowed":"A Slowed Unit loses 50% of its maximum Movement (result rounded down).","Rooted":"A Rooted Unit can\'t willingly Move from its place on its turn except with Abilities (e.g. being pushed, teleporting, etc). It\'s Actions are unaffected.","Dazed":"A Dazed Player Character only has a Half-Action on its turn.\\nA Dazed NPC makes one less non-movement Act (e.g. a Koblod can only make 1 attack instead of 2, a Morloc must choose between using its Net or its standard attack, a monster with only 1 attack can\'t attack, etc).\\n","Stunned":"A Stunned Unit must skip its turn.\\n","Blinded":"A Blinded Unit deals 50% less Damage and Healing and all of its Checks are reduced by 50%.\\n","Silenced":"A Silenced Unit can\'t use any Abilities (but it can use weapons, magic items, etc).\\nPassive Abilities are not affected by Silence, even if magical by nature. If a Spell would be \\"triggered\\" and the caster is Silenced, the Spell can\'t trigger.\\n","Crippled":"A Crippled Unit deals 100% less Damage.\\nNote that percentages stack additively. For example, if you are Crippled but you get an extra 50% Damage from whatever source, you will deal -50% reduced Damage (-100% + 50% = -50%).\\n","Fumbling":"A Fumbling Unit\'s next Act is completely negated (e.g. moving, attacking, casting one Spell, etc). Any actions or resources spent are lost (all Movement is consumed if it was movement).\\nFor example, if the Unit decides to move, the moving is prevented by Fumbling. If a monster wants to make 3 attacks, its first attack deals no Damage and has no effect.\\nA Player Character can freely spend one Half-Action to remove Fumbling.\\n","Feared":"A Feared Unit can only do 1 Act per turn (e.g. moving, attacking, casting one Spell, etc).\\n","Exhausted":"An Exhausted Unit is Dazed and Slowed indefinitely: it has only a Half-Action every turn and -2 Movement Speed.\\n\\nExhaustion does NOT last just 1 turn - Exhaustion from being Fallen is automatically cured 10 minutes after the end of the combat encounter.\\nOtherwise, Exhaustion is cured upon sleeping for 8 hours.\\n\\nYou can also become Exhausted if you go more than 24 hours without sleep, from overdosing on potions (e.g. if you drink more than 1 potion per hour) or from magical effects.\\n\\nSince you are already Dazed and Slowed, being Dazed or Slowed again has no effect.\\n","Other Interactions":"If a Unit gets Crowd Controlled while doing an Act (e.g. you activate a trap while shooting a bow), what happens depends on the Crowd Control type.\\nIf Pushed, the Unit is Pushed immediately (and dashes are cancelled). If the Act was not started yet (e.g. not yet attacked), then the Unit is free to do something else after being Pushed if they want to. However, if the Act already started (e.g. fired 1 out of 3 Magic Missiles), the Unit must continue casting the Spell, on the same target if it was already chosen, only if it\'s still valid (e.g. has Line of Sight or Range). If the Act can\'t be continued due to Range, Line of Sight, etc, then the rest of the Act is cancelled; Actions/Resoureces are NOT regained and are lost.\\nCripple, Daze, Slow: Nothing happens on the spot; the Crowd Control takes effect after the Ability finishes.\\nSilence: If it\'s a Spell, the rest of the Spell gets cancelled; otherwise nothing else happens.\\nStun and other non-listed strong CC: The Ability gets cancelled.\\nBecoming Slowed on your turn immediately reduces your remaining Speed by 2 (but not less than 0, obviously).\\n"},"Weapons and Armor":{"Weapons":"TODO\\n","Armor":"TODO                            # Amror does not require training\\n","Weapon Training (and Shields)":"Every Class gives you Training in at least one weapon category. The categories are 1-Handed Melee, 2-Handed Melee, 1-Handed Ranged, 2-Handed Ranged, Throwing Weapons and Shields.\\nIf you are trained in 1-Handed Melee weapons, it means you are Trained in Shortswords, Daggers, Punches, etc - anything that is 1-Handed.\\n\\nIf you have Training in a weapon, you can attack with that weapon normally (roll weapon Damage and add the Stat the weapon uses, usually Might or Dexterity).\\nIf you attack with a weapon you are not Trained in, it\'s just an Improvised Attack from Default Moves (at close range, it deals 1d4 + Might or Dexterity).\\n\\nSome Abilities might give you Training in specific weapons (e.g. Guns) without giving you Training in the weapon category, though this is a rare occurance.\\n","Throwing weapons":"If you want to throw a weapon that\'s not baseline made for throwing, it is considered an Improvised Attack (there\'s a Default Move Basic Ability called Improvised Attack).\\nThere exists a Feat called Throwing Expert that allows you to throw weapons with their normal Damage.\\nYou still need to be Trained in that weapon to throw it without it being an Improvised Attack.\\n","How to get Training":"Most Classes give you free Training in various weapons or weapon types.\\nYou can get Training in any weapon category by getting the Weapon Training Feat (see Feats).\\nFinally, you can get Training in any weapon by spending one Inspiration Point (see Inspiration).\\n","Swapping Weapons":"At the start of your turn, you can freely choose what weapons to use or swap for the rest of your turn.\\nFor example, when your turn starts, you can choose to prepare one Shortsword and a Shield, or a Greatclub, or a Hand Crossbow and a Dagger.\\nYou can use these weapons however you like on your turn.\\nIf you ever want to swap weapons in the middle of your turn, you must spend a Half-Action.\\n\\nChanging weapons at the start of your turn is encouraged! Use different weapons to your advantage!\\n","Weapon Ranges":"Ranged weapons have a range specified. You can attack normally if you are within that range.\\nIf you attack from more than the weapon\'s range, the attack has a -2 penalty.\\nIf you attack from more than double the weapon\'s range, the attack has a -4 penalty.\\nYou can\'t attack further than that.\\n","Aiming":"You can not aim for a specific area when attacking of using an Ability.\\nHowever, in niche cases, the QM might allow the use of the Aim Ability to aim at a specific point on the target (with consequences decided by the QM).\\n"},"Abilities":{"Abilities explained":"An Ability is simply a block of text that either gives you some thing extra (passively) or gives you something else to do with your Actions rather than attacking.\\nEvery Race and Class gives you some special Abilities. You will know you have these Abilities if they are written on your character sheet.\\nIf you are a Gnome, you have some extra Abilities that Elves don\'t have.\\n\\nLet\'s take a look at exactly what Abilities you start with as a Gnome!\\n\\nFirst off, you have Inherited Tastes. You can see it\'s a Passive Ability, meaning you don\'t need to use it manually; it\'s always there, in the back of your mind. It\'s like an extra trait for your character.\\nInherited Tastes is very simple. You don\'t have a sense of taste, but your eyes perceive colors sharper than most. Doesn\'t sound like much, but it is an Ability!\\n\\nThen, let\'s look at Lucky Presence. This one is an Ability that you can actually use!\\nAfter someone else makes a Check, you can say \\"I use Lucky Presence\\" and they must roll the check again. Presumably, you would use this on your allies when they fail a Check, or on your enemies when they succeed a Check you would\'ve liked them to fail.\\nThere are 2 interesting things about this Ability: the first one is that it\'s a \\"Reaction\\". Reaction is another type of Action that you can only do on others\' turns. You can\'t do just anything with Reactions. Every Reaction is usually an Ability that has a specific time when you can use it. In this case, you must use Lucky Presence when someone makes a Check.\\nThe second thing to look at is the hourglass icon near which it says \\"Long Rest\\". This is called a Cooldown and it tells you how long you have to wait before you can use this Ability again after you use it once. If it has a Cooldown of Long Rest, that means you can use it once, and then you must finish a Long Rest before you can use it again.\\n\\nThat\'s all the Abilities Gnomes start with! Let\'s take a look at another Ability now, to see another example. We\'ll look at the Spell called Bonfire.\\nBonfire is a magical Spell, and it is only available to spell casters, like Mages and Shamans. When you cast this, you choose 1-cubic-meter area where a bonfire is conjured, and it deals Damage! The Aability text itself is self explanatory and straight-forward.\\nBonfire takes 1 Action to do. So, on your turn, you\'d have to choose between attacking and casting Bonfire. Reminder that 1 Action is the same as 2 Half-Actions. So if you cast Bonfire, you can not do anything else with your hands this turn! And if you use one hand for a Half-Action, you can\'t cast Bonfire; because you are left with a Half-Action, and Bonfire takes 1 whole Action.\\nThe last thing to notice about Bonfire is the arrow-and-target icon where it says \\"6 meters\\". This simply means the spell Bonfire has a maximum range of 6 meters. The space you choose to cast Bonfire on must be within 6 meters of you (and you must be able to see the location, of course).\\n\\nOne quick way to differentiate Passive from Active Abilities is that Active Abilities have a square icon, while Passive Abilities have a round icon!\\n\\nLet\'s look into an Ability that\'s a little more _Advanced_, Healing Surge.\\nThe text is very short and straight-forward - you restore 2d6 Health to a Unit. \\nThe \\"Half-Action\\" and \\"5 meters\\" tags should also be self explanatory for you by now.\\nThe \\"1 Mana\\" text refers to the cost of this Ability. The next section will explain Spellcasting.\\n","Ability notes":"Generally, you will have to find a way to keep track of your Abilities. Sure, you can just write down the name of each Ability you have, but then you\'d have to search it online every time you want to do something. The easiest way to keep track is with the Ability Sheet Generator, which can be found at this link.\\n","Ability Tags":"Cooldown, Duration, etc.\\n","Cooldown":"Some Abilities have a Cooldown.\\nCooldown refers to the time you must wait to use the Ability again.\\nAn Ability\'s Cooldown is represented by the _white hourglass_ icon. If an Ability has no such icon, then it has no Cooldown and can be used as often as you like.\\nA Cooldown of \\"Once / Adventure\\" means you can use the Ability ONCE, and then can\'t use it again until you finish the current Adventure.\\nA Cooldown mentioning time (e.g. 1 hour, 1 day, etc) always refers to in-game time, not real-life time. 1 day in game can pass instantly, if the Quest Master says \\"one day passes\\", for example. Like in a book, movie or video game, time in-game passes from scene to scene, according to the adventure story.\\n","Duration":"Duration on Abilities is usually self-explanatory.\\n","Abiliy Requirements":"TODO\\n","Triggering Abilities":"Some Abilities give you free uses of other Abilities. For example, Clerics get to cast Awe for free, even if it\'s on a Cooldown.\\nWhen an Ability tells you that you can \\"freely cast X ignoring its Cooldown/Cost\\", you can cast that Ability in that moment, whether it\'s on Cooldown or not.\\nIf it\'s not on Cooldown, the Ability does NOT go on Cooldown if you trigger a free cast like this.\\nIf it\'s on Cooldown, the Ability remains on Cooldown.\\n","The Rule of Procs":"Some Abilities have effects that happen randomly, at the roll of a die, or apply generally. In gaming, the moment such an effect happens is usually called a \\"proc\\".\\nTo keep the game fast, it is recommended a player is responsible for calling out procs, percentages increases or decreases, etc. If a \\"proc\\" happens but nobody notices it, it is recommended that it does not apply if they remember about it too late.\\n","Spells":"A Spell is an Ability made with magic.\\nAll Spells are Abilities, but only some Abilities are Spells. This only matters in certain niche scenarios.\\n","Mana":"All Classes in the game use a system of points called Mana Points.\\nYou have a number of Mana Points that you can spend to cast some Spells, and you regain all Mana Points back when you start a new Adventure.\\n\\nThe amount of Mana a Spell costs to cast is represented by the _blue flame_ icon and the number near it.\\n\\nFor a clear example, let\'s take a look at the Mage Class. As written on the Mage rules page, Mages start with 3 Mana Points (and get 1 more total Mana every Level). Every Adventure, the Mage can choose to spend these points on casting Spells.\\nEach Spell specifies if and how many Mana Points it costs to cast. If you decide to cast Healing Surge, you must expend one Mana Point and then you are left with 2 Mana Points. It doesn\'t specify that Healing Surge has a Cooldown, so you can do it even twice per turn (since it takes a Half-Action) as long as you have enough Mana Points. If you don\'t have enough Mana Points to cast a Spell, you simply can\'t.\\n\\nWhen building your character, you will have to choose a number of Basic Abilities from the ones available to your class (e.g. Ability Schools, like Elemental, Divine, Warfare, etc) - you can\'t have them all, there are dozens in the game! You\'ll pick a few Spells to have at hand. Mages, for example, start out with 4 + your Intelligence Basic Abilities. So, if your Intelligence is 3, you must pick 7 Abilities (total) from the Elemental and/or Arcane Lists. These will be all the Basic Spells you will be able to use until you finish the current Adventure.\\nYou pick these Abilities aside from your Class Abilities (e.g. Magic Mastery does not count among the 7).\\nCheck our your Class\'s available Ability Lists by going to your Class\'s page, at Spell Casting, under Basic Ability Lists. All Basic Abilities are on the Abilities page.\\nThis is explained in further detail later on (see Basic Ability Lists).\\n\\nYou can keep track of your Mana Points on a sheet of paper, with marbles, dice, etc. It is your job to keep track of your Mana Points. Don\'t cheat!\\n","Basic Ability":"A Basic Ability refers to an Ability from the Basic Ability Lists (see Basic Ability Lists).\\nThey are called Basic because multiple Classes have access to them.\\n","Known Basic Abilities":"Your Known Basic Abilities are very straightforward.\\nYour character can have that many Known Basic Abilities.\\nYou look at the Basic Ability Lists your class has access to (e.g. Clerics have access to the Warfare and Divine Basic Ability Lists).\\nFrom all those Basic Abilities, you pick multiple of them and you have them at a ready. Some of those Spells will cost Mana to use, some not.\\n\\nIf a Spell displays a blue flame icon and a number, then it costs that much Mana to cast it.\\n\\nThese spells represent what your Character has prepared for adventuring. They function exactly like Abilities you have. Inbetween Adventures, you can change what Spells from these Basic Ability Lists your Character knows.\\n","Basic Ability Lists":"Aside from the Abilities you get from your Race and Class, there are also some Basic Ability Lists you have access to.\\nClasses have access to different Basic Ability Lists and can have a number of Basic Abilities chosen from them.\\n\\nA Basic Ability List is simply a list of Basic Abilities. A set of Basic Abilities grouped together based on their theme and category is called a Basic Ability List (themes like Elemental, Nature, Divine, etc).\\nThe text for every Ability is also in that list. Take a look at this page to familiarize yourself with them.\\n\\nAs of 2023, there are 10 Basic Ability Lists in the game: Bloodshed, Warfare, Elemental, Arcane, Nature, Mysticism, Faith, Eldritch and Divine. Clerics, for example, have access to the Warfare and Divine Basic Ability Lists.\\nAlso, Clerics can have 4 + their Intelligence Basic Abilities from these lists (Warfare and Divine).\\nClerics have access to the Warfare and Divine Basic Ability Lists.\\nThis means that if you are a Cleric (and let\'s say your Intelligence is 2), you can pick 6 Spells from _any_ of those 3 Basic Ability Lists and have them at a ready. Some of those Spells will cost Mana to use, some not.\\n","Relearning Abilities (Unlearning)":"All Classes can unlearn and re-learn their Basic Abilities inbetween Adventures.\\nTalents can also be swapped inbetween Adventures (see Respeccing).\\n","Feats":"There exist a set of extra Abilities called Feats (which you can find on the {Feats} page). These usually change how you play your character or give you some extra interesting options, but always have a cost attached (usually in Max Health, Mana, Initiative, etc).\\nYou can get as many of these as you can afford.\\nFeats are optional, and you\'re not necessarily missing out if you decide to play without Feats.\\n","Feat Costs":"If you can\'t afford to get a Feat (e.g. don\'t have enough Max Mana to sacrifice), you can\'t get the Feat.\\n","Somatic, Verbal, Material":"No such thing. Spells just require Actions, Mana, etc. As long as your hands are free and are not Silenced, you can cast Spells.","Spell Components":"Some Spells require a component. Components are consumed upon casting.\\n","Keeping track of your Abilities":"You can keep track of what Abilities you have (e.g. their names) in the Description section of the Character Sheet, on the right.\\nThere is also a page called Ability Sheet Maker (under Learn, Resources for Learning). You can use that app to add your Abilities, then click on Generate to see all your Abilities in a single place. You can take a screenshot of these or right click and save the images as PNG\'s. The list you made should remain saved on your browser, but this is not guaranteed to work.\\n"},"Character Advancement":{"Leveling Up":"By Experience or milestone.","Talents":"From Level 3, every 2 Levels (3, 5, 7, 9), you gain a Talent from your Class Specialization.\\nEvery 2 Levels, you have to pick exactly one from the options at exactly that Level. For example, at Level 5, you can NOT pick one more Talent from Level 2.\\n","Relearning/Unlearning/Respeccing":"All Classes can unlearn and re-learn their Basic Abilities inbetween Adventures.\\nTalents can also be swapped inbetween Adventures (see Respeccing).\\n\\nInbetween Adventures, Player Characters can \\"respec their Talents\\", meaning they can change their Talent Choices (from Levels 3, 5, 7 and 9).\\nFor example, you can unlearn a Level 3 Talent and get a different one instead (from the same Specialization).\\nWhen unlearning a Talent, the Player Character removes all benefits that Talent gave. For example, a Berserker Shaman who unlearns Primal Trophy loses all the extra Health they got from that Talent, as well as all Skills from the trophies. If a Talent offers extra Abilities (e.g. Strangevolution Level 5 Talent from Druid, Coven of the Wild, which gives 2 Racial Abilities), the Player Character loses those Abilities as well.\\nWhen relearning a Talent, the Player Character regains all benefits that Talent gave previously, with the exact same choices and numbers. For example, Primal Trophy will once again give the Health and Skills (as well as remembering how many trophies the character had), and Strangevolution will give back the same 2 Racial Abilities.\\nCharacter Stats, Specializations and Feats generally can\'t be changed, unless the QM allows for this in special circumstances, with things such as a Tome of Unlearning item or undergoing intensive training for a period of time, to retrain the character\'s capabilities.\\n","Gaining Experience":"TODO\\n","Inspiration Points":"In Questguard, the Quest Master can give a player an Inspiration Point for a cool idea, outstanding roleplaying or strategies or, honestly, whatever the Quest Master wants to give Inspiration Points for.\\nGenerally, you can earn an Inspiration Point for impressing the Quest Master or contributing well to the game. It\'s up to each Quest Master to decide what impresses them and when to award an Inspiration Point.\\nInspiration Points are awarded individually. We recommend that the Quest Master awards 1 to 2 Inspiration Points (total, not per player) every session.\\n\\nInspiration Points can be spent to improve your character or influence the tide of roleplaying.\\nYou can spend one Inspiration Point to gain Training in any one Weapon Type (Shortswords, Rapiers, Shields, etc) or gain one Skill from the Skills list.\\nYou can spend an Inspiration Point to also increase your Max Health by 1.\\nFinally, you can also spend one Inspiration Point to nudge a situation slightly in your favor or influence the outcome of a roleplaying situation. This is up to your creativity. For example, if the QM says you can\'t find a Blacksmith in a town, you could say \\"I want to use my Inspiration to actually find a Blacksmith\\". Or, for another example, if you fall down a ravine, you could say \\"I want to use my Inspiration to have remembered to tie a rope to myself before crossing this ravine\\". So, in theory, you could alter the past and the present. Use your creativity!\\nHowever, remember that the QM can refuse to allow you to use Inspiration in a way. Inspiration is meant to nudge the outcomes slightly, not alter whole timelines or create large-scale modifications to the present. Always ask the QM if you are allowed to use Inspiration this way.\\n"},"Items":{"Items (using items)":"Most items you can use in combat take a Half-Action to make (e.g. Scrolls, Potions, Caltrops, etc).\\nEven if a Spell normally takes 0 Actions, the scroll still takes a Half-Action to use. For example, if you have a Scroll of Smite, you must first land a weapon attack, then use the scroll to add the extra Damage (just like Smite says, but with a Half-Action).\\nThere might be situations in which using a Scroll is not feasible.\\n","Potions":"Consuming a Potion takes a Half-Action.\\n\\nEvery Unit can safely use at most one \\"Potion\\" per in-game hour. If a brew restores Health, Mana, Movement, etc (e.g. is not a lasting buff), it counts as a \\"Potion\\". Magical foods with similar properties count as Potions. The Quest Master can choose to rule something as \\"not a Potion\\", which means it can be safely consumed, as per the item\'s rules.    \\nThe second Potion consumed per hour makes the Unit suffer of Exhaustion for 1 hour.\\nThe third and all further Potions consumed per hour make the user pass a Grade 12 Might Check or fall to 0 Health and fall in a coma (Unconscious) for 1 hour.\\n","Scrolls":"A scroll is usually a piece of parchment that has a Spell infused in it. When used, the Scroll releases that Spell and the scroll destroyed. Scrolls are one-time use items.\\nUsing a Scroll takes a Half-Action.\\nYou don\'t need to be a spellcaster to use a Scroll, or expend Mana. Scrolls ignore cooldowns on your Abilities - they have nothing to do with your own Ability Cooldowns or Costs.\\n\\nWhen using a scroll, you use your own Stats for that Spell (e.g. your Intelligence, your Sense, etc).\\nThe scroll Spell does not benefit from effect bonuses increased by your character\'s Levels or by Talents. It is simply a plain copy of a Spell.\\n\\nAs a Quest Master, be careful with how you allow Players to buy scrolls from Shops. Players should not be able to buy all the scrolls they need and stock up on, say, 6 Fireball Scrolls they can just use on a whim.\\n","Magic Items and Soulclaimed":"No soulbound or attunement.\\n"},"Non-Combat and Time":{"Checks":"Whenever a Unit wants to do something that\'s not guaranteed to succeed (e.g. jumping over a chasm), the Unit rolls 1d12 and adds one fitting Stat (Might, Dexterity, Intelligence, Sense or Charisma). Generaly, the Quest Master will call out for a Unit to roll a Check to determine whether they succeed at it.\\nIf the Unit is Skilled at that specific non-combat activity, they can also add their Level. Non-player characters can\'t normally be Skilled in anything. The Quest Master might have an NPC be Skilled at something and provide themselves a bonus for it, of their choice.\\n","Repeating Checks":"Intelligence and Sense Checks normally can\'t be repeated - if one fails an Intelligence or Sense Check, then they simply don\'t know, aren\'t able to comprehend it no matter how hard they try, or can\'t sense what they\'re supposed to.\\nMight Checks normally can\'t be repeated unless the character tries a different approach (up to the Quest Master\'s interpretation).\\nDexterity and Charisma Checks may sometimes be repeated, but, normally, the failure is more disrupting.\\n","Leading Checks and Helping":"If multiple players want to make the same Check (e.g. inspecting for traps, remembering informatio, etc), determine (the Quest Master or the players) which player character is the most qualified for it.\\nOnly the most qualified character rolls the Check.\\nOther characters may try to roll a Helping Check, to help the character rolling the main Check.\\n","Helping Check":"When attempting to help someone else, a character can roll a Helping Check, and add the result to the main roller\'s Check.\\nA Helping Check is equal to a normal Check - 10 (can add the Stat and non-combat Skill).\\nHelping must be decided before the most qualified character makes the roll and helping takes 1 minute.\\n\\nFor example, let\'s assume the most qualified character rolls a main Intelligence Check for a total of 1d12 + 5, and another character decides to roll a Helping Check for a total of 1d12 + 1.\\nIf the main Intelligence Check resulted in 11 (e.g. 6 + 5), and the Helping Check resulted in -2 (7 + 1 - 10), then the final result of the main Check is 9.\\n","Adventure System":"An Adventure is a period of gameplay defined by the QM. An Adventure could be one full dungeon, one quest, one session, or just one day outdoors adventuring.\\nPlayer Characters regain all resources (Health, Mana, Cooldowns, etc) at the end of an Adventure (inbetween Adventures).\\n\\nFor combat purposes, it is recommended that an Adventure contain 3 Medium-difficulty combats (or 2 difficult ones).

When the players reach that milestone in the story (complete a Quest), they regain all resources. In short:\\nPlayers regain all resources upon completing a Quest. Players heal for an amount equal to their Health Regen when completing a Sidequest.\\nThe Quest Master decides what a Completed Quest or Sidequest is - it could be the end of a dungeon, saving someone, or finishing the game session.\\n\\nFor combat purposes, it is recommended that a Quest contain a total of 3 Medium-difficulty combats (or 2 difficult ones), assuming no Sidequests.

A QM might run a story based on the Lord of the Rings books or in some made up world. Some QM\'s have different styles of playing - some are more focused on telling a story, others are more focused on giving the players options. Some are friendly, some... less so.\\nUltimately, just like finding a group to play board games with, you all should have roughly the same expectations and mindset. Some games are more relaxed, drinking and eating pizza. Some are more intense and take things seriously.

Whatever you want to do, it is likely you will need to roll a die for it to determine if you succeed or fail, either as a Player Character or as an NPC or monster.\\nIn the world of tabletop roleplaying, there exists one standard set of \\"polyhedral\\" dice - whether they are Dungeons and Dragons dice or Pathfinder dice, they are all the same and they all work.\\nA set of such dice contains 7 special dice: a 4-sided die, a 6-sided die, an 8-sided die, two 10-sided dice, a 12-sided die and a 20-sided die. Only one such set will suffice for playing Questguard to its full extent, though the more dice you have, the merrier!\\nEach of these dice contains one number on each face: the 4-sided die goes from 1 to 4, the 6-sided die (normal die) goes from 1 to 6, and so on.\\nWherever you live, you can buy a set of roleplaying dice for less than $10 (as of 2023), usually at a board game shop or a gaming store, or, if you can\'t find any, you can order them online. If you can\'t afford that, there are plenty of mobile dice simulators. Just search \\"dice\\" on your mobile application store and there should be several free applications that mimick dice rolling!\\nIf you decide to play online and not at a real table, however, you don\'t need to buy dice and can just use online dice rolling simulators. There are many platforms for online roleplaying and they all incorporate dice rolling simulators.                \\n"},{"title":"Dice notations","value":"Whenever you see a notation like \\"d4\\", \\"d6\\", \\"d8\\", etc, these mean \\"4-sided die\\", \\"6-sided die\\", \\"8-sided die\\", etc.\\nSo, a die with 4 sides is called a \\"d4\\", a die with 6 sides is called a \\"d6\\", etc. \\nIf you see \\"d4\\", that means you\'re supposed to roll a 4-sided die and take that result.\\nIf you see \\"d6\\", that means you\'re supposed to roll a 6-sided die and take that result. And so on and so forth.\\n\\nIf you are ever in doubt about what a certain dice notation means, you can ask your other team mates or the Quest Master - one of them will surely know!\\n\\nQuestguard is a \\"d12 system\\", unlike Dungeons and Dragons and Pathfinder, which are \\"d20 systems\\". This simply means that you will use the d12 die for _a lot_ of things in Questguard. The 12-sided die will be your best friend while playing Questguard, so learn which one it is! Frankly, we believe it is also the prettiest die of them all! Just look at that perfect shape... beautiful!\\n"},{"title":"Dice calculations","value":"When you see notation like \\"1d6 + 1d8\\", that simply means you roll a d6 and a d8, and you add the results together for the final result.\\nNaturall, 1d6 + 4, for example, means you roll a d6 and add 4 to the result.\\n"}]},{"title":"Gameplay Phases","value":[{"title":"Free Roleplay","value":"Questguard is separated into 2 types of gameplay: free roleplay and Combat.\\nIn free roleplay, everyone is allowed to do whatever they like.\\n"},{"title":"Combat","value":"In combat, rules change a bit and we play turn-by-turn, on a grid, and we do damage.\\n"}]}]},{"title":"B.

This can mean attacking, casting a magic Spell, or anything you can think of that uses your hands (usually).\\n\\nThe most standard way to take your turn is to move once and then attack once (or attack and then move).\\nIf you want to do something that uses both hands, that\'s an Action.\\nBut what if you want to do something different with each hand? That\'s where Half-Actions come in.\\n\\nHalf-Actions are exactly what they sound like: using only one hand to do something is a Half-Action, and using both hands to do something is an Action.\\nEssentially, on your turn, you can make 2 Half-Actions (which is the same as an Action).\\nAny Action is just two Half-Actions combined. You want to attack with a 2-Handed Swords? That\'s 1 Action, AKA 2 Half-Actions. You use both your hands for this, and since one hand means one Half-Action, that\'s simply the same as one Action.\\nThe term \\"Action\\" is just another word for \\"two Half-Actions\\".\\n\\nIf you choose to do so, you can even make a Half-Action with one hand, move 4 meters, then make another Half-Action.\\n\\nBut it gets better! You don\'t actually need to keep track of which hand you used already! It doesn\'t matter you already used your right hand to make a Half-Action.\\nOn your turn, you have 2 Half-Actions. Period. They are not tied to one hand or the other in particular. You want to make 2 Half-Actions with the same hand? You are free to do so!\\nIf you have a shield and a 1-Handed Sword, yes, you can make 2 attacks with the same hand with the same sword. But don\'t worry about the numbers; the game is balanced around this.\\n\\nIn the future, when your character becomes more advanced, some Abilities will give you more Actions per turn! If you have a total of 2 Actions on your turn, that\'s exactly like having 4 Half-Actions. And you\'d be able to make 4 attacks with the same hand and weapon, or one attack with a 2-Handed Weapon and 2 attacks with 1-Handed Weapon. You\'re free to do whatever you want with your hands!\\n\\nWhen you attack with a weapon, you roll the weapon\'s dice and subtract the enemy\'s Defense.\\n\\nEvery weapon in the game does a certain amount of Damage and all weapons can be found on the Weapons page.\\nEvery weapon also benefits from either your Might or your Dexterity.\\nFor example, a Club deals 1d10 Damage and uses the Might Stat. So, whenever you attack with the Club, the Damage done by that attack is 1d8 + your Might. If you are the sneaky, slim Gnome, that means 1d8 - 1, which is not very good.\\nThe Whip, however, deals 1d4 + 3 Damage and uses Dexterity. Thus, if you are the sneaky Gnome, the Damage will be 1d4 + 6, which is much better!\\n\\nYou roll the Damage, and the enemy subtracts the Damage you deal from their Health Points. Your job is to get them to 0 or less Health.\\n\\nHowever, every character and monster has another number called Defense. Whenever it is attacked, their Defense reduces the amount of Damage they take by that amount.\\nFor example, if you attack the Bear and the attack would deal 7 Damage, the Bear does not just lose 7 Health, but instead subtracts its Defense from the attack.\\nBears\' Defense is 4, so, whevener the Bear is attacked, it reduces all incoming Damage by 4. 7 becomes 3. That\'s the final amount of Damage the Bear takes.\\n\\nTo conclude, the final Damage of your attack is: (Weapon Damage) + (your Might or Dexterity).\\nIn this particular case with you being the Gnome and the enemy being the Bear, the total Damage is (1d6 + 1) + (3) - (4).\\n\\nNo matter if you use a 1-Handed Weapon (with Half-Actions) or a 2-Handed Weapon (with Actions), the formula is the same. Even if you use both hands, the formula doesn\'t change. It\'s always the same.\\n"},{"title":"My Health and Mana","value":"How much you can resist in combat is determined by your Health Points.

You can just say \\"Let\'s take a Long Rest\\" and the Quest Master might just say \\"Done, 8 hours have passed\\".\\nTake note that you can not Long Rest while camping in a forest, in a dungeon, wilderness, etc!\\n\\nDuring the gaming session, you will have to keep track yourself of how many Health Points you have, either on a sheet of paper or in a document.

You will know you have these Abilities if they are written on your character sheet.\\nIf you are a Gnome, you have some extra Abilities that Elves don\'t have.\\n\\nLet\'s take a look at exactly what Abilities you start with as a Gnome!\\n\\nFirst off, you have Inherited Tastes. You can see it\'s a Passive Ability, meaning you don\'t need to use it manually; it\'s always there, in the back of your mind. It\'s like an extra trait for your character.\\nInherited Tastes is very simple. You don\'t have a sense of taste, but your eyes perceive colors sharper than most. Doesn\'t sound like much, but it is an Ability!\\n\\nThen, let\'s look at Lucky Presence. This one is an Ability that you can actually use!\\nAfter someone else makes a Check, you can say \\"I use Lucky Presence\\" and they must roll the check again. Presumably, you would use this on your allies when they fail a Check, or on your enemies when they succeed a Check you would\'ve liked them to fail.\\nThere are 2 interesting things about this Ability: the first one is that it\'s a \\"Reaction\\". Reaction is another type of Action that you can only do on others\' turns. You can\'t do just anything with Reactions. Every Reaction is usually an Ability that has a specific time when you can use it. In this case, you must use Lucky Presence when someone makes a Check.\\nThe second thing to look at is the hourglass icon near which it says \\"Long Rest\\". This is called a Cooldown and it tells you how long you have to wait before you can use this Ability again after you use it once. If it has a Cooldown of Long Rest, that means you can use it once, and then you must finish a Long Rest before you can use it again.\\n\\nThat\'s all the Abilities Gnomes start with! Let\'s take a look at another Ability now, to see another example. We\'ll look at the Spell called Bonfire.\\nBonfire is a magical Spell, and it is only available to spell casters, like Mages and Shamans. When you cast this, you choose 1-cubic-meter area where a bonfire is conjured, and it deals Damage! The Aability text itself is self explanatory and straight-forward.\\nBonfire takes 1 Action to do. So, on your turn, you\'d have to choose between attacking and casting Bonfire. Reminder that 1 Action is the same as 2 Half-Actions. So if you cast Bonfire, you can not do anything else with your hands this turn! And if you use one hand for a Half-Action, you can\'t cast Bonfire; because you are left with a Half-Action, and Bonfire takes 1 whole Action.\\nThe last thing to notice about Bonfire is the arrow-and-target icon where it says \\"6 meters\\". This simply means the spell Bonfire has a maximum range of 6 meters. The space you choose to cast Bonfire on must be within 6 meters of you (and you must be able to see the location, of course).\\n\\nOne quick way to differentiate Passive from Active Abilities is that Active Abilities have a square icon, while Passive Abilities have a round icon!\\n\\nLet\'s look into an Ability that\'s a little more _Advanced_, Healing Surge.\\nThe text is very short and straight-forward - you restore 2d6 Health to a Unit. \\nThe \\"Half-Action\\" and \\"5 meters\\" tags should also be self explanatory for you by now.\\nThe \\"1 Mana\\" text refers to the cost of this Ability. The next section will explain Spellcasting.\\n"},{"title":"Ability notes","value":"Generally, you will have to find a way to keep track of your Abilities. Sure, you can just write down the name of each Ability you have, but then you\'d have to search it online every time you want to do something.

This only matters in certain niche scenarios.\\n"},{"title":"Mana","value":"All Classes in the game use a system of points called Mana Points.\\nYou have a number of Mana Points that you can spend to cast some Spells, and you regain all Mana Points back when you start a new Adventure.\\n\\nThe amount of Mana a Spell costs to cast is represented by the _blue flame_ icon and the number near it.\\n\\nFor a clear example, let\'s take a look at the Mage Class. As written on the Mage rules page, Mages start with 3 Mana Points (and get 1 more total Mana every Level). Every Adventure, the Mage can choose to spend these points on casting Spells.\\nEach Spell specifies if and how many Mana Points it costs to cast. If you decide to cast Healing Surge, you must expend one Mana Point and then you are left with 2 Mana Points. It doesn\'t specify that Healing Surge has a Cooldown, so you can do it even twice per turn (since it takes a Half-Action) as long as you have enough Mana Points. If you don\'t have enough Mana Points to cast a Spell, you simply can\'t.\\n\\nWhen building your character, you will have to choose a number of Basic Abilities from the ones available to your class (e.g. Ability Schools, like Elemental, Divine, Warfare, etc) - you can\'t have them all, there are dozens in the game! You\'ll pick a few Spells to have at hand. Mages, for example, start out with 4 + your Intelligence Basic Abilities. So, if your Intelligence is 3, you must pick 7 Abilities (total) from the Elemental and/or Arcane Lists. These will be all the Basic Spells you will be able to use until you finish the current Adventure.\\nYou pick these Abilities aside from your Class Abilities (e.g. Magic Mastery does not count among the 7).\\nCheck our your Class\'s available Ability Lists by going to your Class\'s page, at Spell Casting, under Basic Ability Lists.

If any of the lines is obstructed by an obstacle, then it has Cover.\\n\\nCover is not necessarily 2-way. If you have Cover from an enemy, it does not mean the enemy has Cover from you. Apply reason. You shoot an arrow from the tip of your weapon and aim to hit any body part of the enemy. You, as the attacker, can keep the rest of your body safe while only exposing part of yourself when attacking. When in doubt, apply common sense or ask the Quest Master.\\n\\nFor example, if you are hiding behind a rock and another Unit shoots an arrow at you that would normally deal 8 Damage, the arrow now deals 6 Damage. Or, if a Unit makes you roll a Dexterity Check and you have Cover from that Unit, you gain +2 to the roll. Or, if a Unit casts Magic Missiles on you and shoots 3 missiles (1d4 each), and you have Cover from that Unit, each missile will now deal 1d4 - 2 Damage (down to 0).\\nTip: If you play on a grid and walls obstruct Line of Sight strictly around the corners of its squares, then a ranged Unit can hide behind the margin of a wall and shoot from there if it has Line of Sight from any of its space\'s corner to any of the enemy\'s space\'s corners. If the line in the Line of Sight merely touches the space of the wall, then it\'s ok; it does have Line of Sight. If it goes through that space, then it does not have Line of Sight (see the Line of Sight rule for a more detailed explanation).\\n\\nCertain Abilities ignore Cover.\\n\\nCover does not stack (e.g. you can\'t get 2 Covers and take -4 Damage - it\'s still just one Cover, just -2).\\n","Flanked (+1)":"Melee attacks on Flanked Units gain +1.\\nIf you are melee-attacking a Unit and there\'s one of your allies directly behind (1 meter) your target, the attack is Flanking and gains +1.\\nNormally, you, your target and the ally behind it are supposed to form a straight line for the attack to count as Flanking, but this works even if your ally behind the target is one space too much to the left or to the right (but still within 1 meter of the target).

qw=JSON.parse('{"Where to find monsters":"All monsters are found at QM Resources > Monsters.\\nBefore continuing to read this section, take a look at some Monsters to get used to the monster stat block.\\nMost numbers you see are self-explanatory, but all other things are explained below.\\n","How to play monsters":"Monsters function similarly to players, but with a few simple changed rules:\\n1. Monsters have fixed initiative and don\'t roll for initiative (and their initiative is unaffected by Dexterity or Charisma; the number you see at Initiative is what you get).\\nSome monsters have different Initiative if they start as Ranged attackers vs if they start as Melee attackers.\\n2. Monsters don\'t have Half-Actions and Mana\\nEach turn, a monster can choose one of its Abilities (the white blocks with a RED line on top).\\nIf an Ability says it\'s free, then it takes no Action (0 Actions) (e.g. Naga Mage - Enslave Magic can be cast by each Naga Mage once per combat, for free, without using an Action).\\nIf an Ability says (x2) or (x3), then the monster makes that many attacks with that Ability (e.g. Koblods 1H Weapon). So, if a monster decides to use that Ability, if it says (x2), then it will use that Ability TWICE. For our Koblods, their 1H Weapon Ability has an (x2) noted and it deals 1d6 + 2 Damage, so all Koblods make 2 attacks, each of which deals 1d6 + 2.\\nFor 1 Action, Monsters can make the following Default Moves (even if they cost a Half-Action): Sprint, Taunt, Push, Taunt, Intimidating Mock. Defend applies twice (as if it used it twice, for 2 Half-Actions).\\n3. Some monsters have fixed Damage per attack, but might also have a dice alternative. Prefer using the fixed values if there are any, to make combat faster. Monsters can choose to roll the dice if needed, if the fixed Damage is just too low (e.g. 5 Damage but the target has 6 Defense).\\n","$Monster Passives":"Each monster might have some Passive Abilities (white blocks with a BLUE line on top).\\n","$Monster suggestions":"On the right side of the monster page, there are some simple suggestions for how to play monsters of that type (e.g. \\"Koblods run away after they finish attacking\\", or \\"Each Stonemantle flies and targets one enemy\\").\\nThere are also suggestions on what obstacles to add to the fight, what other monsters to add to the encounter, and there might also be some ideas for interesting ways to use the monsters.\\n","$Playing monsters fairly":"Monsters should generally try to distribute their attacks and Damage among the players.\\nIt doesn\'t feel fair if all the monsters to attack a single player and kill them in the first round of combat. Try to have monsters attack different targets.\\n","Encounter XP":"Building a combat encounter for your players is very simple!\\nEach team of Players or Monsters has a certain Encounter Budget. Each Player has an Encounter Budget and the total Encounter Budget of the party is the sum of all players\' Encounter Budgets.\\nSame for monsters. The total Encounter Budget of a group of monsters is equal to the sum of each monster\'s Encounter Budget.\\nA Level 1 Player has an Encounter Budget of 100 XP.\\nWhen building an encounter, the idea is to have the Player Encounter Budget be equal to the Monster Encounter Budget for a standard, medium difficulty encounter.\\nA perfectly balanced encounter is intended to take away 50% of all players\' Health and 33% of their total Mana.\\n","$1. Calculate the Encounter Budget for the players":"Each Player\'s Experience Budget goes from 100 XP at Level 1 to 400 XP at Level 10.\\nSee the table below for accurate XP information.\\nNote that 175, 275 and 375 are skipped straight to 200, 300 and 400. That\'s because of the power spikes for the players at certain levels.\\nSo, if you have 4 Players of Level 1, that\'s 4 x 100 XP, so 400 Experience Budget for a party of 4 Players of Level 1.\\n","$2. Calculate the Encounter Budget for the monsters":"Each monster has a different Encounter Budget. For example, a Wolf has 75 XP, but a Gnoll has 150 XP. A Fairy Dragon has 500 XP.\\nYou must mix and match monsters so their total Encounter Budget is somewhat equal to the players\' total Encounter Budget.\\nFor a party of 4 Players of Level 1, 4 Bat Swarms is exactly a medium difficulty encounter (100 XP * 4). 5 Wolves (75 XP * 5) is also a somewhat medium encounter for our player group (375 XP for the wolves).\\n","$Encounter Budget for monster numbers (important)":"The more monsters you add to an encounter (respecting the Encounter Budgets), the EASIER it is.\\nFor example, let\'s compare two different encounters: 4 Koblods (4 * 100 XP = 400 XP) and 8 Hounds (8 * 50 = 400 XP). These two encounters have the exact same Budget.\\nHowever, the 8 Hounds encounter is easier, because of several reasons:\\n1. Players have Area Abilities, and can kill multiple Hounds at the same time.\\n2. It\'s easier to kill each Hound one by one (e.g. even if 2 Hounds are as strong as 1 Koblod, if one Hound dies from 10 Damage, then 1 Hound remains and it\'s weaker than 1 Koblod; on the other hand, 1 Koblod doesn\'t die from 10 Damage).\\nTo balance this, subtract 5% from the Encounter Budget for each extra monster more than the number of players. So, if we have 4 Players and 8 Hounds, that is 4 extra Hounds compared to the players. 4 * 5% = 20%. So we subtract 20% from our 400 XP hounds (20% 400 XP = 80 XP) and we find out that the true Encounter Budget of our Hounds encounter is actually worth only 320 XP. 320 XP is an Easy-Medium encounter for the players.\\nYou should not subtract more than 50% from the Encounter Budget.\\nOn the other hand, having fewer monsters than the number of players should not require a decrease in XP budget.\\n","$Monster Degree":"Monsters are either Normal monsters or Epic monsters (bosses).\\nNormal monsters are normal.\\nEpic monsters take MULTIPLE turns, one after another, depending on their Degree.\\nFor example, an Ogre has a Degree of 2. That literally means an Ogre will take 2 turns in a row (e.g. moves and takes an action, then starts its next turn and can move and take an action again).\\n","Epic Monsters":"Epic monsters take MULTIPLE turns, one after another, depending on their Degree.\\nFor example, an Ogre has a Degree of 2. That literally means an Ogre will take 2 turns in a row (e.g. moves and takes an action, then starts its next turn and can move and take an action again).\\nAlso, an Epic monster must alternate its Abilities (non-passives). If it has 3 Abilities, it can\'t choose to use only one of them all the time. It must use the first Ability on one turn, then the 2nd Ability next turn, an then the 3rd Ability on its next turn. Then it can use the 1st Ability again on the next turn, and so on.\\nIt is up to the QM to choose the order of the Abilities.\\nIf the Epic monster can\'t use an Ability, it will not use it. If it has no other Abilities to use, and can\'t use that Ability or it makes no sense to use that Ability, it will just not do an Action.\\n","Epic vs Normal Monsters":"You might be asking yourself, for example - what is the difference between a 500 XP normal monster and a 500 XP x2 Epic monster in terms of strength?\\nA 500 XP x2 Epic Monster is akin to 2 250 XP normal Monsters, and takes 2 actions, thus making it easier to spread out Damage. Its stats are also calculated to match 2 250 XP monsters - slightly lower total Damage output and health.\\nA 500 XP normal Monster will usually make one attack that deals massive Damage. The danger here is that one very high XP monster might kill a player character in one hit, while the Epic monster will spread its Damage out.\\n","$Monster Degree Note":"Note that Crowd Control lasts for 1 turn. If your monster has a Degree of 2, it takes 2 TURNS, one after another. The Crowd Control only lasts for ONE turn, so it applies to its first turn only, NOT to both (if its lasts normally for 1 turn).\\nAlso, if the Epic monster has a Crowd Control on it (e.g. is Stunned), and another player adds another Crowd Control (e.g. another Stun), the second Stun does NOT go on the monster\'s second turn. All the Crowd Control from the players is applied to the monster\'s first turn only.\\n","Homebrewing Monsters":"The best way to make a homebrew monster is to take the stat block of an official existing monster, keep its Health, Defense and XP (or slightly change them) and give it different Stats, Abilities, Passives, etc.\\nWhen you make custom Abilities for your monster, do check out the Abilities of other similar monsters to see how powerful they should be.\\nIf you want to make a homebrew monster by the book, check the following table for some standard numbers.\\nAdust the Health of a monster by about 10% for each extra/missing point of Defense compared to its base Defense from the table (e.g. For a 100 XP monster with 4 Defense, it should have about 18 Health).\\nFreely add certain Damage type resistances or Crowd Control to monsters.\\n","Homebrewing Philosophy":"When making a homebrew monster, apply the following suggestions:\\n- Crowd Control should require a Check (e.g. don\'t make an Ability that just outright Roots or Silences the player)\\n- Avoid Stuns, Paralyses, Sleep etc. It\'s not fun for a player to skip its turn.\\n- Do give your monster Silence, Daze, Fumbling, Slow, Fear or Blind Abilities. These will make your players alter their playstyle.\\n- Do give your monster 50% Resistance to certain Damage types (within reason). These will also make your players alter their playstyle.\\n- Do make the Health of some monsters be 50% Shielding instead of Health. Some Player Abilities might remove Shielding.\\n- Avoid giving Epic Monsters extra bonuses to Resist Checks; Stat bonuses should be enough, plus they take multiple turns.\\n- Avoid giving Epic Monsters \\"Epic Resistances\\" (e.g. \\"if it fails a Resist Check, it can choose to pass it instead\\"). This is a special thing some monsters have in other games, but Questguard does not endorse this type of Ability.\\n- Avoid \\"Pass or Die\\" Abilities (e.g. avoid giving your monsters Abilities that do huge amounts of Damage if the player fails the Check, or Abilities that do huge Damage directly).\\n- Avoid crazy dice swings (e.g. avoid giving monsters attacks that can wildly swing between very little Damage or a lot of Damage). For example, avoid giving your monster an attack that deals 2d12 Damage, because that is at minimum 2 Damage and at maximum 24 Damage, but the average is 13 Damage. If you want to deal 13 Damage, a more fair roll would be 2d8 + 4, or 2d6 + 6, or 4d4 + 3, for example.\\n- Do be inventive and creative! Give your monsters certain small gimmicks!

As for tweaks, expect some tweaks to the Druid in the future.\\n"},"Update Philosophy & Future Changes":{"Intro":"It can be disheartening to see your character becoming obsolete one update after another, and I truly do understand the feeling of seeing your character changed, nerfed or have parts of it removed.\\nI assure you, my intention is not to undermine players, prevent them from having fun or make changes just for the sake of change.\\nSo let me explain a few things, as well as output a new way of moving forward.\\n","Changes & Design Explained":"All changes I make are to further 3 main goals of the game: simplicity, customizability and flow.\\nThe game should be simple, choice-wise deep, and game elements should flow together.\\nI am also moving forward to adding a 4th goal - having to track less (e.g. Reserve Health, Holy Points, etc).\\n\\nNerfing races and classes or removing parts of them can feel bad, but ultimately I am concerned with how the class or race feels to start playing, without overwhelming a player who is seeing that for the first time. If things I remove are actually fun, I will put in the Class as a Talent you can get later, or as a Feat or separate choice.\\nCertain gameplay aspects objectively do not fit the philosophy and goal of the game. Like the Warlock, who had way too much going on at Level 1, the Summoner and Shaman who were just tables and numbers simulators, etc. That sort of gameplay is not coming back.\\nThere are also outliers like the Paladin, which (in my opinion) didn\'t flow very well, and I am still totally open to changing it again to something that is simple, but fun.\\n   \\n","Locking in Changes":"There will soon come a time when I will lock-in game features, and say \\"This is unlikely to get significant changes in the future\\".\\nWith this update, I will also let you know what is most prone to change in the future.\\nNumbers are more prone to change, however, as I constantly discover miscalculations, or notice something is not balanced properly.\\n\\nAs time goes on, and more updates come out, \\n\\nIf a game feature is stable, I will mark it as \\"stable\\", while other things I will mark as \\"unsure\\" or \\"likely to change\\".\\nHere is a full list, which I will keep updating moving forward.\\n","Core Rules":"The overall flow and rules of combat (Actions, Damage, etc) are *stable*, along with things like Stat Distribution (-1, 0, 1, 2, 3), Mana, etc.\\nCrowd Control is *mostly stable* (Dazed, Charmed, Fumbling - *Unsure*).\\nMost of the core rules are also *stable*.\\n","Races":["All races may get more Racial Ability Choices, or have some Racial Ability Choices changed.","????

Cleric - Likely to change (Awe is cool, Light Cleric too; expect a rework in the same style as the Light Cleric)","?? Paladin - Likely to change entirely"]},"Update 2024-06-16 - Character & Cooldown Update":{"Sum Up":"Put on your seatbelts, because this update is a very big one. Here are the focuses of this update:\\na) Make Stats more impactful on character creation\\nb) Make weapons more accessible\\nc) Move away from Once / Adventure Cooldowns\\nd) Make Ability Sheets smaller\\nThe Stats (Might, Dex, etc) have been reworked, and Leveling Up has also received big changes - it\'s now easier and more intuitive.\\nThere are core weapon changes, no more Weapon Training and some improved rulings.\\nSeveral classes have received changes to Once / Adventure Abilities, many of which now have no Cooldown or have a much less strict Cooldown.\\nThis update I want to try something strange, which, if it does\'t work, we\'ll revert it.\\n","Stats Revamped":"Character Creation is receiving a revamp to make Stats more impactful on your build and provide you with more customizability!\\nStats are pretty much the same, just the Character Creation is influenced by the stats more now.\\n\\nMight now further affects Max Health, Dexterity affects Movement, Intelligence affects Known Abilities, Sense affects Health Regen and Charisma affects Initiative.\\n\\nHealth is calculated as Race Health + 200% of Might.\\nMovement is calculated as 5 + 50% of Dexterity (rounded down). Having -1 or 0 Dex = 4 Movement, 1 or 2 Dex = 5 Movement, 3 and 4 Dex = 6 Movement, etc.\\n\\n_Why It\'s Changed_ - If you wanted to play a \'martial\' character, you had to pick Might or Dexterity as your highest stat. Might was also disproportionate, since it affects both survivability and damage, while Charisma and Sense got the short end of the stick.\\nThe new way the Stats work should give players more incentive to try out unusual builds that are all viable, without one Stat being the go-to Stat.\\nI don\'t expect it to be perfect, but I think it\'s probably the right direction for Stats.\\n","Character Creation - New Calculations":["Health = Race Health + 200% Might","Movement = 4 + 50% Dexterity (rounded up). Having -1 or 0 Dex = 4 Movement, 1 or 2 Dex = 5 Movement, 3 and 4 Dex = 6 Movement, etc.","Known Abilities = 2 + Intelligence (with some exceptions). Characters no longer gain +1 Known Ability per Level (I\'ll explain why below)","Regen = Race Regen + Sense","Initiative = 300% Charisma","Number of Skills = Sense or Intelligence, whichever is higher","Number of Languages = Charisma or Intelligence, whichever is higher"],"Intelligence Known Abilities Explained (Tentative?)":"It may sound like I am taking a lot of options away from characters. I\'ve noticed the vast majority of players don\'t use their Known Abilities to their full potential, and with +1 Known Ability per Level, it is going to quickly clutter up the Ability Sheets.\\nI\'d rather keep the Ability Sheet simple, and, instead of having _more_ Abilities, I\'d rather have _fewer_ Abilities that can _do more_ in and of themselves.\\n\\nFor a lot of the Basic Abilities, I have changes planned to make them more interactive, flow better and have more possible combos, so fret not.\\n\\nIt also makes the process of choosing your Abilities more thoughtful.\\nFor those of you who still want to have a ton of available Abilities, you can still spec into Intelligence, and there are several ways to get more Abilities as well.\\n","Weapons Training \\"Reworked\\" (Tentative?)":"Getting rid of one more thing on the Character Sheet / Character Creation, to go hand-in-hand with the new Stats.\\nThere is now no such thing as Weapon Training. However, weapons now require a minimum certain Stat to wield.\\nWeapons that do require MIG or DEX have a slightly better effect, slightly better damage or have a cooler effect.\\nAlso, there\'s one more new aspect to weapons now...\\n","Runes":"I want it to be clear for non-MIG and non-DEX characters that weapons are still usable, so I am introducing a new weapon mechanic - Runes.\\nAny weapon can be inscribed with one Rune. There are 4 baseline Runes that can be purchased from any regular magic shop.\\nMind Rune (makes weapon scale with INT), Spirit Rune (makes it scale with SEN/CHA), Element Rune (makes Damage type Fire/Cold/Shock) and Traditional Rune (removes weapon Stat requirement).\\nThis leaves room for other magical Runes that could enchant weapons further and make them stronger (even magic weapons).\\n\\n_Why It\'s Added_ - I want SEN/INT/CHA builds to be less restraining. There were already Feats for this (Mastery and Battle Mage), but since Feats are optional, it may not be immediately obvious to players that you can have an INT build, for example, and still have a strong weapon attack.\\n","Level Up Changes":"I hope you hate tables as much as I do - removed the Level Up table and replaced it with small choices for Levels 4, 6 and 8.\\nLeveling Up should now be a lot more streamlined, knowing you only get some extra stats and whatever the Level Talents say you get. For Levels 4, 6 and 8, you usually get what you used to get before, or a more interesting small choice.\\n","Health & Regen Changes":["Adjusted Health and Regen for most Races, but, overall, Starting Health increased by 2 for all Races. Vigor removed from Paladins and Warriors. This is to account for the new Might Health calculation.","Health / Level reduced by 1 for all Classes. This is because you now get extra Health from some of the Level 4, 6 and 8 Talents."],"Cooldown & Cost Updates":"Going forward, I want to move away from Once / Adventuer Abilities, and keep only strong Abilities as Once / Adventure.\\nIn this update, I am buffing or changing many Abilities to be usable more, either removing the Cooldown completely or changing it to Once / Combat.\\nAll animals (Hunter Pets and Druid Animals) have been buffed (no more Once / Adventure Cooldowns, now Once / Combat) and have received tweaks to make them easier to understand and more interesting.\\nAlso greatly simplified many of the Feats for Multiracing and removed Mana cost from multiple Feats.\\n","Orc Redesigned":"Changed the Orc to be more like the Elf, and not be locked with specific Abilities.\\nOrcs now start with the Stat Distribution -1, -1, 3, 3, 3, and can get any number of Racial Abilities they want, but each will cost -1 in a chosen Stat.\\n","Ambushing (Changed)":"If one or more Units _want_ to attack another party, and that party would logically have no time to react, everyone rolls Initiative normally, but the ambushing Units gain +5 to the Initiative roll.\\n","Percentages (Revert)":"Going back to percentages always being rounded down. Always rounding in the players\' favor makes everyone\'s brain melt slightly more than it should.\\nThe final number, after all percentages are calculated, is rounded down.\\n","Renames (For Copyright)":["Dragonsworn < Dragonborn (the plural is not Dragonsworns)"],"Reworked Bloodshed and Warfare Lists":["(Removed) Aim","(Removed) Hamstring","(Removed) Lightstrike","(Removed) Atonement","(Removed) Battle Trust","(Removed) Slam (*)","(Removed) Lightstrike (*)","(Changed) Recuperate","(Changed) Off-Hand Shank (previously Shank)","(Changed) Assess Their Ranks","(Improved) Bull Rush","(Improved) Whirlwind (with High Noon variant)","(Improved) Glory Shout","(New) Hack and Slash (with variants) (somewhat replaces Slam)","(New) Painful Puncture (replaces Lightstrike)","(New) FURY","(New) Snap Out Of it","(New) All Veins Burning","(New) Lance Heave (with variants) (replaces Slam)","(New) Sword and Board","(New) Tactical Aim","(New) Gladiator Grandeur","(New) Doublesault","(New) Bravery Despite Fear"],"Cleric Changes":["(Changed) Blessing (now includes Spread the Awe in the same effect)","(Removed) Spread the Awe","(Changed) March Ahead","(Changed) Heavy Burden","(Changed) Exigent Concession (previously War Smite)","(Changed) Grasping Awe (previously Grasp)"],"Druid Changes":["(Changed) Treesposition"],"Hunter Changes":["(Removed) Combo Set (Watcher Level 3 Talent)","(New) Chaos Form (Watcher Level 3 Talent)","(New) Focus Form (Watcher Level 3 Talent)","(Buff) Warden Corral (1 minute duration <- 1 turn)","(Changed) Most pet Abilities now have a shorter Cooldown"],"Mage Changes":["(Reworked) Magic Mastery (Your next Basic Spell (from an Ability List) that costs 1 Action now costs a Half-Action instead, but has all ^Dice Downgraded^ to the previous die tier)","(Changed) Grand Wizardry","(Changed) Destruction","(Reworked) Sorcerer Unstable Spark and Overcharge","(Changed) Mild Magic","(Changed) Arcane Comet","(Changed) Star Burst","(Changed) Honorificabilitudinitatibus (lol)","(Changed) Double Spark Triple Quark"],"Warrior Changes":["Charge/Uncharge range (2 <- 3)","Changed several talents to be more interesting, easier to understand, and not have a Once / Adventure Cooldown","Made Barbarian Trances more interesting and useful."],"Website Update":"Heavily improved the website quality on mobile and the main page now has a nice, sleek look on mobile!\\nAdded some nice animations on the website.

It\'s just that - a number. With the changes on the wording of Checks, I think this number no longer serves a purpose. The aim of the game is to be as easy to understand as possible, without taking away from complexity. Fare well, Spell Grade! You might be missed, but I won\'t!\\nSpell Grade has been removed and replaced with something else, which differs on a case-by-case basis. Some Abilities require the monster to make a Check (against a specified number or stat), others will have you make the Check instead. Others will have you make a Check against an enemy\'s Check! Other Abilities will no longer need a Check at all, and the effect simply happens.\\nThis works together with the Crowd Control buff - I reanalyzed how strong Crowd Control is and came to the conclusion that a lot of it is not useful enough, mathematically speaking. A lot of Crowd Control Abilities have been made stronger by removing the Check from the enemy, or by making the requirement easier.\\nHowever, this is not the case for stronger CC like Stuns and Roots! There is genuinely a lot to unpack - a lot of Abilities have been modified. Check them out!\\n","Checks Reworded":"To make it more clear to players and GM\'s alike, Abilities now state that a Unit make a Check *at least* a number. No more debate of whether getting an equal number is a pass or a fail.\\nThere was actually no change to suggested Check difficulty. If you roll a 15, you still pass a \\"difficult\\" Check or such. The wording is mostly for Abilities.\\nI thought this was relevant enough to add to the update notes.\\n","Cover, Blind & Percentages (Tentative)":"Made Cover reduce Damage by 50% (tentative).\\nYou\'re free to continue playing with the -2 rule, but I\'d love to see some feedback on the 50% rule.\\n_Why It\'s Changed:_ I want to remove as many strange numbers as I can, to reduce the player likelihood of asking \\"is this before or after 50% resistance?\\". However, if this proves to be too much for just Cover, we\'ll revert the change.\\n\\nAll percentages are now calculated in players\' favor. If you \\"reduce all incoming Fire Damage by 50%\\", you take 2 Damage instead of 5, but the monster takes 3 Damage instead of 5. The GM can choose to overrule this.\\n_A reminder that percentages are additive - 50% reduction with 50% reduction = 100% reduction, NOT 50% of 50%._\\n","Quest System (Tentative)":"Trying out changing the Adventure system to the Quest system. A completed Quest (or Sidequest) is a milestone for the players. When the players reach that milestone in the story (complete a Quest), they regain all resources. In short:\\nPlayers regain all resources upon completing a Quest. Players heal for an amount equal to their Health Regen when completing a Sidequest.\\nThe Game Master decides what a Completed Quest or Sidequest is - it could be the end of a dungeon, saving someone, or finishing the game session.\\nPlayers can relearn Abilities and Talents after completing a Quest.\\nA Quest may or may not have a clearly defined start or end.\\nAs a GM, feel free to say a Quest is complete whenever you feel the players need to recover their resources. If the players ask \\"Was this a quest?\\" you have the option to say \\"It was a Sidequest\\".\\n_Why It\'s Changed:_ There are several reasons I believe Quests may be a better system. While writing the starter adventure Whispervale (spoilers), I realized it\'s difficult to organize it into Adventures. The Quest system, however, made room for a clearly defined time when players get back their resources. Quests also give a bit more direction to GM\'s for when to say \\"the Adventure is finished\\", and with Sidequests, it gives players some more extrinsic rewards for adventuring. Finally, there is a lot more flavor to Quests rather than Adventures - it feels better when you say \\"Quest complete!\\" than \\"Adventure finished\\". Quests also act like milestones and thus the reward can be Leveling Up. Need I mention it is also in the name of the game?\\n","Other Changes":["Changed Silence - a Silenced Unit can\'t use **any** Ability (not just Spells).","Changed Cripple - a Crippled Unit deals 100% less Damage.","Changed Blind - a Blinded Unit has 50% less Damage, healing and Checks.","Made some adjustments to armors","Made adjustments to Health Regen numbers"]},"Update 2023-12-31":{"Sum Up":["This update is also quite a large one, focusing on reworking a core mechanic, removing/heavily reworking a class and bringing a lot of quality of life improvements to the game and even to the website (Desktop version)"],"Reworked Paladin (Tentative)":"Even though the Paladin has been a popular class, I tend to believe it\'s so due to the class fantasy and certain interesting Abilities, without the core mechanics being very interesting.\\nPaladins have been reworked from the ground up and have their own gimmick now: they no longer have Mana. Instead, they can cast any spell they have for free, once per turn, provided they haven\'t already cast it already.\\nAside from that, Paladin specializations have been changed again to be more thematic and play into the class fantasy: Order of the Crusade, Order of the Tome and Order of the Templar, with Talents to double down on Paladin concepts, like being a Black or a White Knight, a Crusader, or even putting your faith on pause.\\n","Behind The Design (Paladin)":"Paladins had nothing truly interesting going on - they were simply a class with high stats, high damage and healing.\\nThe Talents themselves were quite lackluster except for a few of them. Paladins also required a lot of tracking: tracking mana, tracking Holy Points, tracking Vengeance, etc.\\nThis update had several goals for the Paladin: reduce number tracking, make them have an interaction with Basic Abilities and simplify Talent options with more Talent interactions with the core class Abilities and between eachother.\\nOverall, even if it feels like Paladins lost some power and the new Faith Casting seems unusual, I believe these will make the Paladin stand out more rules-wise and be easier and more fun to play.\\nIf after a while we realize that Faith Casting doesn\'t work and feel as planned, we\'ll go back to Mana.\\n","Reworked Hunter Core (Tentative)":"To make things more interesting, let\'s double down on this idea: Hunter now no longer has Mana either... at all.\\nTo compensate, several Talents were made stronger, Hunters have normal Health / Level and gain +1 Stat every 3 Levels.\\nHunters have also reaceived extra Talents that were previously missing.\\n","Behind The Design (Hunter)":"Hunters have always had an unusual power dynamic - the pet is free damage every turn, and can also act as a meat shield, and revived after every combat.\\nThat make it so that Hunters had 0 Mana, low Health (which discouraged a more melee playstyle) and could not afford some more powerful Talents.\\nRemoving Mana altogether from the Hunter means it can focus on what it does best and what is most fun, without having to trade off power in other areas.\\n","Reserve Health is now Health Regen (Tentative)":"After every Worthy combat, automatically heal for an amount equal to your Health Regen, up to 3 times per Adventure.\\nHealth Regen is determined by your Race, plus your Level, plus your Might (e.g. 6 + Level, 5 + Level, etc).\\nThis makes it much easier to calculate Health Regen (no more recalculating Reserve Health when increasing Max Health), balance Health Regen for some characters, requires less tracking and provides more interesting options.\\nAs such, some Races have been rebalanced to be more interesting regarding Health Regen and Max Health.\\nThis is a tentative change - if it doesn\'t work, we\'ll revert back to Reserve Health, but let\'s give it a try!\\n","Replaces Keyword (Tentative)":"I changed the wording on several Abilities to make them easier to track on a sheet or a sheet of paper.\\nSeveral Class Abilities now read as \\"Replaces X\\". Instead of getting a Passive new Ability that upgrades a different Ability, you get a new Ability altogether that replaces the old one.\\nFor most of these, there is no functional change; it\'s exactly the same. It\'s just a wording difference.\\nLet me know if you feel like this is more intuitive or not.\\n","Class Feats":"Some Classes now have Feats! Certain awkward Talents have been made into Feats instead.\\nAs always, Feats allow for unique character builds and better customization, all while being completely optional! More is better!\\nWe have Talents such as Lich Ritual (now available for Mages and Warlocks too), Old Ritual and Lycanthropy for Druids and Lone Wolf for Hunters. More to come\\n","Affliction Feats":"Added a new category for Feats called Afflictions. These are (at first glance at least) negative conditions for the character: missing an arm or a leg, being blind or deaf or having a chronic illness.\\nI don\'t think anyone has played with these so far, but it\'s a good punishment from the GM in case they want to cut off a leg or two, or be affected by radiation poisoning in the eyes!\\n","Humans Reworked":"Humans should naturally be the simplest Race to create and play (and the way they were, Humans were the most difficulty to create). As such, Humans have been greatly simplified.\\n","Cool new website updates!":["You can now literally copy a spell and paste it in paint or any image editor. Try it! (as such, removed the Spell Sheet Maker page for now)","Added a Magic Items page, for GM\'s only. _Notice some icons glow? Click on them and see what happens!_","Added a Custom Ability Creator page!

I am forever grateful for all the friends I\'ve made and for all the amazing people I\'ve met, and here\'s to another year of awesome people and interesting campaigns!\\nHere is what I am planning with QuestGuard in the coming year.\\n","Dave Campaigns":{"1. Starter Adventure":"In the first part of 2024, I will be working on a starter adventure mini-campaign that I will wrap nicely inside a booklet, which will be available either as a separate module or part of the core rulebook.\\nI aim for a 4-6 session campaign that\'s easy to read and introduces all the rules of QuestGuard to new players, one by one, in an easy-to-understand fashion.\\nI will most likely run this campaign once or twice, and then hopefully other people can help run it as well to get feedback!\\n","2. Ironborn Campaign (?)":"For the current players who took part in Nordheim, I\'m planning another campaign or series of mini-campaigns aiming to continue the arcs established in Nordheim.\\nThis would take place in the \\"Outerworlds\\" (placeholder name) where the Ironborn resides. There, the players\' new characters will explore a strange and deadly realm and meet old heroes, such as likes of Loki, Flyxer and Ilda, and find out what they\'ve been up to.\\nThis is, of course, still heavily in planning; stay tuned, I\'ll let everyone know if and when this happens!\\n"},"QuestGuard Updates":{"Look and Feel":"Planned very soon, there will be a slight redesign of certain elements on the website, and I will also put together a free book template, which will reflect the book version of the game, and which players will be able to use to homebrew any type of content! I am already working with a graphic designer for this, so fingers crossed!\\nThere will also (finally) be an update to the mobile version of the website.\\nI will also want to try out a hand-drawn version of the art on the website. Depending on whether some of the people in the community want to help or if we can make it look great, replacing AI art with human-made art is definitely something that\'s possible!\\n","Game Rules":"There are many things that still need work in QuestGuard as a game. Here are a few of the updates you should expect this year:\\n- Level 9 Talents and Level 10 Ultimate Ability for all Classes\\n- A complete set of Basic Abilities and Magic Items up to Level 10\\n- Extra Feats and options for all Races and Classes\\n- More monsters, aiming for 150 monsters by the release of the game\\nAmong these, we can expect to finalize several rules of the game. There will be changes still! I can already foresee some rules and core systems that will probably be changed, but ultimately there will come a point where I believe the game is in a good enough state!\\nSome things that I will want to experiment with are reworking Spell Grade, some extra roleplaying rules, trying out some different variants of Inspiration points, and more.\\n","Reworks":"You can expect several reworks of some more game elements. The first class on the list to be reworked is the Cleric.\\nRaces such as the Bertles, Davels and Elves have a nice core idea, but I think they\'re not very well executed. Expect changes to multiple races.\\nThe same goes for certain Classes and specializations.\\nOf course, things may change. Feedback comes in all the time so let\'s see what happens!\\n","Other":"Expect also that many things be renamed, especially monsters and Abilities. Let\'s try to avoid copyright infringement!\\n"}},"Update 2023-10-17":{"Sum Up":["This update is a large one, but without focuses on _reworking_ core things but rather changing numbers for the better of the game, and adding a lot of extra content. Here is a sum-up of the changes.","Certain Classes and Specializations have received reworks. Other classes and specializiations have received minor changes or tweaks",{"Specific Changes":["Druid (Coven of the Land redesigned, and removed Coven of the Wicked specialization - it was combined with the Shaman Witch Doctor specialization)","Mage (Wizard and Sorcerer redesigned)","Shamans (complete redesign)","Warlocks (reworked base class, added Channeler specializiation and removed Summoner specializiation)"]},"Abilities were changed to _squish_ numbers a bit - after the Defense update, numbers got a bit too large. Not nerfs/buffs, just all numbers have been slightly reduced (monster Health too)","Feats reimagined - Feat Points don\'t exist anymore. Instead, every character can freely get as many Feats as they want, up to 1 every 2 Levels. However, each individual Feat now has a cost (like Multiclassing Feats). This way, you can balance out your character, and also not feel like you\'re missing out if you don\'t get want any Feat.
