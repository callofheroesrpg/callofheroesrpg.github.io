If you want to be a hero inside another Game Master\'s adventure, you need to create your hero, called a Character!\\nBefore you even create a Character, you should talk to the GM about what kind of character fits inside their story.\\n","What Makes A Character?":"Every character is a combination of a Race, a Class and, of course, a personality, look and backstory. These all should be taken into consideration when creating your character in relation to the story you\'re taking part in.\\nThis section will go over the (now written) social rules when playing the game with a group of people.\\nFor a GM\'s story, you will create your character to your likings; however, you should try to be aware of the social etiquette, explained in the following points.\\n","How Do I Come Up With A Character Idea?":"What sounds cool\\nRace/class/background for inspiration\\nIf you\'re just starting out, you should first think about what Class you want to play from a _coolness_ standpoint.\\nJust pick what sounds the coolest to you!\\nIn the current version of the game, the official classes are the following.\\n\\nCleric - a religious spellcaster who\'snot afraid to fight; Clerics are generally solid healers (medics) and have good access to disruption against enemies (Crowd Control); Clerics are also the necromancers and shadow priests of the game. Examples of Clerics are Anduin, Lady Mellisandre, Moses, Faust from Shaman King.\\nDruid - a nature spellcaster who can transform into animals; Druids are wildcards and can have the most varied playstyles, intertwining nature magic with the whimsical or dark arts. Examples of Druids are Radaghast the Brown, Malfurion, Poison Ivy.\\nHunter - a ranger or slayer of monsters, sometimes fighting alongside a trusty animal companion; Hunter are not necessarily ranged attackers and they do have access to nature Spells as well. Examples of Hunters are Legolas, Geralt from the Witcher.\\nMage - a heavy user of magic, generally more frail than most, but possessing vast knowledge and powerful spells; Mages are also artificers who can create magical artefacts, bend time, conjure elementals, transform into dragons and much, much more. Examples of Mages are Merlin, Gandalf, Lina.\\nPaladin - an honorable knight who uses both physical prowess and faith-based magic; not all Paladins are good - some are cruel conquerers or zealous fanatics. Examples of Paladins are Garen and Kayle from League of Legends, Uther and Arthas, Hollow Knight.\\nRogue - a sneaky thief, asassin or ninja, great at isolating and taking out enemies; Rogues can become spellcasters too, or, if they choose so, they can be all-out swashbucklers. Examples of Rogues are Ezio or Altair, Garrett from Thief, Corvo.\\nShaman - a primal caster, using the powers of spirit, mind and body in communion; Shamans can be witch doctors, as well as heavy duty berserkers with a thirst for blood. Examples of Shamans are Wargs from Game of Thrones, Thrall, viking berserkers, Nazeebo.\\nWarlock - a spellcaster who received their powers from a patron; although usually evil, Warlocks can be good and have good or chaotic patrons; Warlocks are the demon tamers and shadowblades of this world. Examples of Warlocks are Kayn and Varus, Aleister Crowley, Gul\'dan.\\nWarrior - a physical fighter who uses technique and force to down enemies; contrary to popular belief, not all Warriors are melee fighters or brutes. Examples of Warriors are Conan, Ser Jorah.\\n"},"g3":{"Fitting In - Overall Character":"When you play in a GM\'s story, it\'s important to consider social etiquette and respect the rules of the story.\\nAlthough some points might seem obvious, always keep the following questions in mind and try to respect the social norms of the game you take part in.\\n","1. Does My Character Personality Fit?":"You don\'t want to create a Sci-Fi space marine for a story like Lord of the Rings. That would be silly and break the immersion for other players, and make the story less believable.\\nDoes your GM run a dark, gritty, fantasy story? Maybe a witch hunter-type character would do fine, or a dark sorcerer of some sort. Is it a very light-hearted high fantasy experience, with lots of color and dragons everywhere? Maybe something magical would do! Is the story more realistic, with less magic? Perhaps a human warrior would be the best.\\n\\nDo talk to your team mates about what type of character they want to create.\\nRemember that tabletop roleplaying games usually put emphasis on immersion, meaning that players like to submerge themselves in the story and fantasy of the made-up world, and play it as if they live it!\\nIf you want to create a funny or joke character, make sure everyone is on-board with that. Don\'t show up at the game with a comedic, unserious character if everyone is taking it seriously.\\n\\nLastly in this section, make sure your character wants to work with a team to achieve a goal. Lone wolf characters sound cool, but in practice, the best characters are the one who want to work as a team! You and your fellow players are a team! Always remember that!\\n","2. Do My Character Capabilities Fit?":"Another thing to consider is what kind of gameplay will be the most prevalent. Some GM\'s run stories with a lot of fighting, while some run stories with more talking (roleplaying), exploring, etc. Maybe your GM\'s story is a murder mystery, or the exploration of an abandoned castle.\\nThe number 1. rule is to always ask the GM \\"would my character fit your story?\\".\\n\\nYou don\'t want to show up with a brutish barbarian in a game about politics and talking your way out of situations. Similarly, you don\'t want to show up with a character with no combat prowess in a game about slaying hordes of monsters in dungeons.\\n\\nTalk to your GM.\\n","3. Does My Character Story Fit?":"Similar to the first point, you must consider your character\'s backstory when joining a GM\'s story.\\nWhen you create your character, you will probably want to give it a made-up history: a war veteran who lost their son in a battle, or a mage who gave up studies to become a warrior.\\n\\nMake sure this fits the story setting. If your character was born in King\'s Landing from Game of Thrones but the story takes place in Middle Earth, you should rethink your backstory.\\nA good rule of thumb is to leave certain aspects of your character\'s backstory up to interpretation by the GM. That brings about more story possibilities and gives the GM a chance to surprise you with some interesting findings about your character\'s past!\\n\\nFinally, but very importantly, does your backstory even matter? Your GM might run a game where all players wake up and have amnesia. Or they might give you a specific backstory. In that case, you should understand your backstory might not matter all that much, if at all. Always ask the GM!\\n","4. Am I Respecting The Custom Rules?":"Generally, characters start being Level 1 adventurers and progress in power up to Level 10 characters. However, the GM might have you start at another level, like Level 2 or Level 5.\\n\\nAside from that, the GM might impose custom rules for character creation, like not allowing certain Races or Classes in the game. If you have a dream character, make sure your choices are allowed in the GM\'s story.\\n"},"KE":{"Character Creation Basics":"Characters have 2 sides: the gameplay side, and the roleplay side.\\nThe roleplay side is what you want to look like and what your personality will be. These are not rules , but simply a matter of preference. Are you charismatic, fearful, intense, funny?\\nYour personality does not affect combat or rolls - it is simply how you want to interact with the world created by the Game Master.\\n\\nThe gameplay side refers to the rules and capabilities of the character.\\nEach character is a combination of 3 things: Race, Class and Background.\\nEach possible Race, Class and Background can be found on the official website and in the books.\\n","Character Sheet":"Each Character is represented on a sheet of paper (or digitally) on a document called the Character Sheet.\\nThe Character Sheet is a document that holds all the important stats and data about your character.\\nThe easiest way to make a Character Sheet is to download this form-fillable PDF. It contains modifyable text forms for everything your character needs that\'s gameplay-related!\\nAlthough, note that as of 2022, if you open this PDF in the browser, you might not be able to re-save it completed! To be sure, use an application like Adobe PDF Reader or WPS to open it, modify it and save it. Always remember to save it again!\\n\\nAlternatively, feel free to use a regular sheet of paper, an Excel spreadsheet, or whatever you consider a good option.\\nIf you play in a physical location at a table, it might be a good idea to print the Character Sheet on paper for ease of use and modification.\\nIn the following sections, we will go over each statistic necessary for your Character.\\n","Character Creation Helper":"There is a web application called Character Creation Calculator, which can be found on the official Call of Heroes website. This Application will calculate all the numbers for your character, without you needing to do it manually (e.g. calculating your Health depending on your Race, Class and Stats).\\nHowever, it may be useful to understand how these calculations happen, since most of them are very simple.\\nThe following sections also describe what each of those terms means and gives extra context.\\n"},"uO":{"Stats Explained":"Each Character must have a somewhat balanced stat distribution - everyone is really good at something and realy bad at something else. Your Stat with -1 will be what you are bad at.\\n\\nIn Call of Heroes, there is no rolling for stats (like in other games). These numbers represent directly your Stat. If you make a Dexterity Check, you roll 1d12 and add your Dexterity to it. If your Dexterity is 3, then you roll 1d12 and add 3.\\n\\nThere are no _substats_ like in other games (e.g. Skills in Dungeons and Dragons, like Acrobatics, Intimidation, or Reflex/Fortitude/Will in Pathfinder). Checks are done directly with the Stat\'s number (roll a d12 and add the Stat).\\n","Race Stat Constraints":"Some Races put a constraint on your Stat distribution. For example, the Orc Race (Race Features > Stat Distribution) says that your Might must be at least 2.\\nThat means that your Might must be either 2 or 3 from the numbers -1, 0, 1, 2, and 3. This does NOT mean that if your Might is -1 it becomes 2!\\n","Stat Calculations Reminder":"The following section will describe how each number is calculated.\\nReminder that there exists a Character Creation Calculator which automatically calculates these numbers based on your Race/Class/Background choice and your Stats.\\nIt is, however, good to know how they are calculated.\\n"},"ki":{"ty":"Race Health + Class Health + Might","fD":"Given by your Race, at Race Features","a3":"Your Dexterity + Your Charisma","Cm":"Depending on your Class, you can wear Armor of a certain heaviness up to a limit. If your Class permits Medium armor, then you can wear Light and Medium Armor.\\nWhen you create your Character, pick any Armor you can wear from the Armors page.\\n","$l":"Your Armor Type you are wearing. When you create your character, you can start with any armor from the armor types you can wear. Check the Armors page on the website or in the book.","g2":"Look at Race Features > Weapons and Other Training to see what you are Trained in.\\nEach Race and Class provides you with some Training in Weapons.\\nIf you are Trained in a weapon, you can use it properly. Otherwise, you can\'t add your Stat to the attack\'s damage (unless it\'s -1) and the weapon\'s effect is negated (see Weapon Training).\\nSo, if you plan on using a certain weapon, make sure you have Training in it.\\nSome Races and Classes only give you the Training if your Intelligence is high enough when you create your character.\\n","lI":"All Races speak the Common tongue (for our purposes, English).\\nMost Races and some Classes have some extra languages they can speak.\\nLike with Training, some Races and Classes require you to have a certain amount of Intelligence to know them.\\n"}}');function Mt(e){var t=e.children,n=(e.hasMarginTop,e.style);return(0,Oe.jsx)("div",{className:"page-h3",style:n,children:(0,Oe.jsx)("h3",{children:t})})}function Lt(e){var

The game is easier to learn, play, host games for as a Game Master and provides more combat options and strategies packed in a simpler set of rules.\\nWe created this game out of love for tabletop roleplaying games and disappointment with many aspects of existing systems. Our CoH community feels many aspects of the traditional tabletop games are lackluster and not designed for the modern world. It is a game in the same genre as D&D and Pathfinder: it\'s made for a fantasy setting, has turn based combat, etc. If you played either of these systems, you will find CoH very easy to pick up!\\n","Is this a D&D offspin?":"No. It\'s a different game. However, Dungeons and Dragons and Pathfinder are the main inspiration sources for Call of Heroes.\\nWhile exploring the rules of Call of Heroes, you will find a lot of simplification for the better. Many features are removed and tweaked, and other features have been added, all for the sake of modernization and ease of play without taking away from the fun parts. We have removed what\'s not fun and made what\'s already fun even more exciting! However, Call of Heroes is not merely a modification of D&D. It is not a form of 5.5th Edition or an offspin. It\'s an entirely different game and should be treated as such. Content is not backwards compatible with neither D&D or Pathfinder - but it is better!\\n","Why Call of Heroes and not D&D?":"Blalaflala\\n"},"CoH For D&D Players":{"D12 System":"Call of Heroes is a d12 system instead of d20. When you make a check, you roll a 12-sided die and add any modifiers to it.\\n12 sides instead of 20 sides makes Checks less swingy and makes adding numbers easier.\\nCritical successes and failures can happen when rolling a d12 - if you roll 12 on the die, that counts as a Critical Success and it counts as if you rolled 15.\\nRolling a natural 1 is not considered a Critical failure. Instead, a Critical Failure happens when your total result is 0 or less (from a negative modifier, like having -1 in a certain Stat).\\n\\nWhen in combat, there is no rolling to hit - you roll damage directly and subtract Defense.\\nHowever, Critical Strikes do exist in combat as well, but they are specific to various weapons and Spells. If a weapon or Spell can Critically Strike, it is mentioned in the weapon/Spell text (with what needs to happen for it to be a Critical Strike).\\n","Characters":"This section explains the basics of the player characters. Later sections describe how combat works and how Game Mastering is different from other systems.\\nLike in D&D, a character is defined by a Race, a Class and a Background. Each Class has a different set of specializations and each Race a set of extra Feats.\\nEach Specialization provides tons of options for character customization!\\n","Player Character Progression":"In Call of Heroes, characters go from Level 1 up to Level 10. In terms of how much time and experience it takes to get from 1 to 10, it\'s not the equivalent of getting from 1 to 20 in D&D.\\nIn fact, getting from Level 1 to Level 10 in Call of Heroes is slightly faster than going from Level 1 to Level 10 in Dungeons and Dragons.\\n\\nHowever, the levels _are_ more packed and flavorful than in D&D!\\nEvery 2 Levels, you get to pick a class Talent from 3 to 4 choices. These are talents are usually powerful Abilities that define your playstyle! This means that, judging only by the number of Talents, each Specialization has over 500 possible Talent combinations, and that\'s not even counting your starting Racial Talent, feats and other Class choices (e.g. Warlocks and Clerics get another set of extra Talents at Level 1). Pick your poison!\\nLeveling up happens either through Experience Points awarded by the GM (from killing monsters, completing puzzles, etc) or through a milestone system (e.g. leveling up after completing a certain part of the story).\\n","Character Stats":"Ability Scores (from D&D) are called simply Stats in Call of Heroes.\\nThere are 5 Stats in Call of Heroes: Might, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma.\\nStrength and Constitution are combined into one single stat: Might. Might affects damage with some weapons and your base Health. The overall Health is determined more by your Class and Talents rather than by your Might. So don\'t worry! You\'re not losing on that much Health if you choose to start with -1 Might.\\nWhen you create your character, you assign the following numbers in any order to your Stats: 3, 2, 1, 0, -1. Every Character will have one strong Stat and one weak Stat.\\nThere are no tables for converting a Stat to a Modifier like in D&D. The Stats themselves are the modifiers. It\'s that simple!\\nYou gain extra Stat Points at Levels 4 and 8 and you can also get extra Stat Points through Feats and Talents.    \\nYou might be thinking about how Races affect your Stats. Instead of giving you extra points in some Stats, Races impose some extra rules for distributing Stats. For example, Orcs allow you to put assign your Stats however you like with those numbers as long as your Might is at least 2.\\n\\nUnlike in D&D, there are no sub-stat Skills (Athletics, Perception, etc). Instead, all Checks are done directly with the Stat and the player can choose in some cases which Stat they want to use.\\nInstead, to specialize in different skills, there exist Proficiencies!\\nBecause there are too many sub-stats to cover all possibilities, each Race, Class and Background gives characters Proficiency in certain skills of choice.\\nProficiencies are worded in such a way that they are applicable to more situations than in D&D! For example, if you have Proficiency in Intimidation, you will get a bonus to all rolls for Intimidation, whether you want to use your Charisma or your Might.\\nThis makes the life of both the Game Master and the Players easier. No longer do they have to memorize all 20 sub-skills. If it\'s jumping, it\'s either Might or Dexterity! And if a player knows they\'re good at jumping, they\'ll just call it out and add the Proficiency bonus.\\nThe Proficiency bonus is equal to your Level. So, even if your Intelligence is low, you might still know a lot about Occultism. After all, it makes sense you do if you grew up in a coven of witches...\\n","Combat, Turns and Actions":"Just like in D&D, combat happens on a map (preferably on a grid).\\nEach player rolls Initiative (1d12 + Initiative) to determine their turn order. Monster usually have a fixed Initiative, so similar monster groups take their turns at the same time, thus increasing the speed of preparation for combat.\\n\\nIn a turn, a Unit can move up to its speed and use 1 Action, which can be divided into 2 Half-Actions.\\nThere is no Bonus Action, but there are plenty of Abilities that cost 0 Actions (are completely free and can do as many as you like per turn).\\nLike in D&D, each Unit also has a Reaction they can use during other Units\' turns for some situational moves.\\n\\nHalf-Actions are useful because provide more options during combat. As a general rule of thumb, an action taking 2 hands usually costs 1 Action. If it can be done with one hand, it usually takes a half action.\\nDon\'t worry though! Each Ability is well worded and specifies how many Actions it takes to make.\\n\\nSaving Throws are simply called Combat Checks and are rolled with the Stat Modifier. Some Talents and Abilities grant you bonus modifiers to certain Combat Checks.\\n","Moving":"Inherit from Rules.yml","Attacking and Defense":"To recap, on your turn, you have 1 Action, which can be divided into 2 Half-Actions.\\nAttacks with one-handed weapons take a Half-Action and attacks with two-handed weapons take 1 Action.\\n\\nWhen you Attack with a weapon, you roll directly for damage - there is no rolling to hit. You then subtract the target\'s Defense from the damage, and that\'s the final result damage the target takes.\\nAssuming you are Trained in the weapon you are attacking with (see Training), the attack deals (weapon base damage) + (your Might or Dexterity, as mentioned by the weapon). Each Weapon is used with either Might or Dexterity. When you attack with a weapon, you roll the weapon\'s base damage and you add either Might or Dexterity, depending on the weapon.\\nFor example, Clubs deal 1d8 damage and use Might as their Stat. So, if you have 3 Might, you will roll 1d8 + 3. If you roll 4 on the d8 and the target has 5 Defense, the final damage is 4 + 3 - 5 = 2 damage. The target takes 2 damage.\\n\\nSome Spells are considered attacks, in which case they are \\"against Defense\\" (you subtract the target\'s Defense, normally, like you would with a weapon attack).\\nIf something does not mention it is an attack or is \\"against Defense\\", then you can assume it deals the damage directly - what you roll is what you deal.\\n","Weapons":"As reported by many players, weapons in Call of Heroes are \\"cooler than in most RPG\'s\\".\\nEach Weapon has a special effect that makes it different from all other weapons.\\nSome weapons can land critical strikes, while others can deal more consistent damage, heal you, ignore Defense, etc. Check out the Weapons page and choose your favorite!\\n","Abilities":"An Ability can either mean a Spell, a feature, a passive trait, etc. It\'s an all-encompassing word for \\"something you can do\\". Healing Word is an Ability and also a Spell. Action Surge is an Ability, but not a Spell. Highlander Technique is an Ability, but it\'s passive (it\'s always active).\\nAbilities are very straight forward, without much fodder text and extra noise.\\nAside from the name and marvelously illustrated icon, each Ability clearly states how many Actions it takes, its range, cost, etc.\\nAbilities that need disabmiguation have some extra notes attached at the bottom of the Ability box.\\n\\nMost spells do not have a verbal or material component requirement and can be cast just by using your hands. If you can\'t use your hands, you can\'t use Actions and thus you can\'t cast Spells. That\'s as simple as it gets!\\nThere are some exceptions to this, of course, but if it\'s an exception, you\'ll see it written explicitly in the Ability box.\\nTidbit - there is a type of Crowd Control called Silence that completely blocks the flow of magic of a caster and prevents all spells from being cast.\\n","Spell Casting Systems":"There are two equivalents to the Spell Slot mechanic of D&D: Mana and Insight.\\nEach Class, including non-spellcasters like Warriors, uses one of the two systems mentioned above (Mana or Cooldowns).\\n\\nClerics, Mages, Rogues, Warlocks and Wariors use Mana to cast Abilities.\\nMana functions exactly like Spell Slots. However, in Call of Heroes, Spells are not categorised by levels.\\nInstead, each Spell costs a number of Mana points and a player\'s character has a certain number of Mana.\\nThus, if you have 5 Mana (that recovers on Long Rest), you can choose to spend 2 of it on a Spell that costs 2 Mana. You\'ll be left with 3 Mana until your next Long Rest.\\nIf a Class is Mana-based, you can prepare a number of Spells from its available lists of Spells (Elemental, Conjuration, Divine, etc) and have them ready to cast. Most of the time, prepared Spells can be changed on Long Rests.\\nSome Spells do have a character Level requirements, though! Fire Ball is only usable by Level 4 or above characters!\\nPreparing Spells is simply called Knowing or Learning Spells.\\n\\nIf your class is Insight-based, you can know a number of Generic Abilities from your Spell Lists.\\nHowever, instead of Mana, you have Insight.        \\nIf a Spell displays a _team eye_ icon and a number, then it takes up that much Insight to _know_ it.\\nIf you don\'t have enough Insight left to learn (Know) a Spell, you can\'t learn it (obviously).\\nYou can think of Insight as \\"available memory\\". Some Spells occupy \\"memory\\" (Insight).\\nMost Insight Spells have a Long Rest Cooldown.\\n","Cooldowns":"Cooldown is a term borrowed from video games. It refers to a time you must wait between casts. If a Spell has a cooldown of Long Rest, it means you can\'t use it again until you finish a Long Rest.\\nCooldowns are generally not based on time, but rather on checkpoints. Once per combat, once per Long Rest, once per Turn, etc.\\n","Main Stat and Other":"The equivalent of Spellcasting Ability is the Main Stat.\\nThe Main Stat is the one used to determine your Spell DC (called Counter Check Grade) and it\'s equal to 6 + Main Stat.\\nIn the case of multiple Classes, you can choose between 2 options of Main Stats. If you can choose between Intelligence and Charisma but like Charisma more, feel free to use Charisma.\\nThe equivalent of Spell Attack Modifier is the Main Stat itself. But by default, there is nothing to take note of. If you need to add the Main Stat to something, it\'s explicitly written in the Ability text.\\n"}}');function rn(){Object.keys(on).filter((function(e){return"default"!=e}));var e=on["About The Game"],t=on["CoH For D&D Players"];function n(e){var t=e.object,n=e.title;return(0,Oe.jsxs)("div",{children:[(0,Oe.jsx)(Mt,{children:n}),(0,Oe.jsx)("p",{children:t[n]})]})}function a(e){var t=e.object,a=e.title,o=e.children,i=e.type;return i=null==i?"normal":i,(0,Oe.jsxs)(dt,{type:i,children:[(0,Oe.jsxs)(mt,{children:[" ",(0,Oe.jsx)(n,{object:t,title:a})," "]}),(0,Oe.jsxs)(mt,{children:[" ",o," "]})]})}return(0,Oe.jsxs)("div",{children:[(0,Oe.jsxs)(wt,{style:{whiteSpace:"pre-wrap"},children:[(0,Oe.jsx)(vt,{children:"D&D Transition Guide"}),(0,Oe.jsx)(ft,{children:"About The Game"}),(0,Oe.jsxs)(dt,{children:[(0,Oe.jsx)(mt,{children:(0,Oe.jsx)(n,{object:e,title:"What is Call of Heroes?"})}),(0,Oe.jsx)(mt,{children:(0,Oe.jsx)(n,{object:e,title:"Is this a D&D offspin?"})})]})]}),(0,Oe.jsxs)(wt,{style:{whiteSpace:"pre-wrap",overflow:"hidden"},children:[(0,Oe.jsx)(ft,{children:"Basic Rules Transition"}),(0,Oe.jsx)(a,{object:t,title:"D12 System",type:"lefty",children:(0,Oe.jsx)("img",{src:"/Rules/D12.png",style:{width:"55%",marginLeft:"22%",marginTop:"25%"}})}),(0,Oe.jsx)(n,{object:t,title:"Characters"}),(0,Oe.jsx)(a,{object:t,title:"Player Character Progression",children:(0,Oe.jsx)("img",{src:"/Rules/Talents.png",style:{width:"160%",marginLeft:"-15%"}})}),(0,Oe.jsx)(Mt,{children:"Character Stats"}),(0,Oe.jsx)("p",{children:t["Character Stats"].split("\n\n")[0]}),(0,Oe.jsxs)(dt,{children:[(0,Oe.jsx)(mt,{children:"TODO"}),(0,Oe.jsx)(mt,{children:(0,Oe.jsx)("p",{children:t["Character Stats"].split("\n\n")[1]})})]}),(0,Oe.jsx)(n,{object:t,title:"Combat, Turns and Actions"}),(0,Oe.jsx)(n,{object:t,title:"Abilities"}),(0,Oe.jsx)(n,{object:t,title:"Spell Casting Systems"}),(0,Oe.jsx)(n,{object:t,title:"Main Stat and Other"})]})]})}function sn(){var e=Object.keys(Zt).filter((function(e){return"default"!=e&&"Custom Background"!=e})).map((function(e){return _e({Name:e},Zt[e])})),t=Zt["Custom Background"];return(0,Oe.jsxs)(wt,{title:"Backgrounds",children:[(0,Oe.jsx)("p",{children:"A Background is one of the 3 components of a Character (Class, Race and Background).

Players should not be able to buy all the scrolls they need and stock up on, say, 6 Fireball Scrolls they can just use on a whim.\\n","Inspiration Points":"In Call of Heroes, the Game Master can give a player an Inspiration Point for a cool idea, outstanding roleplaying or strategies or, honestly, whatever the Game Master wants to give Inspiration Points for.\\nGenerally, you can earn an Inspiration Point for impressing the Game Master or contributing well to the game. It\'s up to each Game Master to decide what impresses them and when to award an Inspiration Point.\\nInspiration Points are awarded individually. We recommend that the Game Master awards 1 to 2 Inspiration Points (total, not per player) every session.\\n","What Can I Do With Inspiration?":"Inspiration Points can be spent to improve your character or influence the tide of roleplaying.\\nYou can spend one Inspiration Point to gain Training in any one Weapon Type (Shortswords, Rapiers, Shields, etc) or gain one Proficiency Ability from any Background in the Backgrounds list.\\nYou can spend an Inspiration Point to also increase your Maximum Health by 1.\\nFinally, you can also spend one Inspiration Point to nudge a situation slightly in your favor or influence the outcome of a roleplaying situation. This is up to your creativity. For example, if the GM says you can\'t find a Blacksmith in a town, you could say \\"I want to use my Inspiration to actually find a Blacksmith\\". Or, for another example, if you fall down a ravine, you could say \\"I want to use my Inspiration to have remembered to tie a rope to myself before crossing this ravine\\". So, in theory, you could alter the past and the present. Use your creativity!\\nHowever, remember that the GM can refuse to allow you to use Inspiration in a way. Inspiration is meant to nudge the outcomes slightly, not alter whole timelines or create large-scale modifications to the present. Always ask the GM if you are allowed to use Inspiration this way.\\n","Movement":"Every Unit can move in combat. When you see the term \\"move\\", \\"moving\\", \\"Movement\\", etc, that always refers to walking, running, jumping, etc; moving never refers to making Actions (with your hands).\\n\\nOn your turn, you can move once a number of meters equal to your Speed.\\nYou can\'t split your Movement around Actions. You can move before or after attacking or casting a spell or doing any action, but once you move once, that\'s it! You can\'t move again until next turn! For example, you can\'t move 2 meters, take an Action (even if it\'s 0 Actions) and then move again.\\nNote that you can freely switch direction while moving, if it\'s in the same movement. If you want, you can move in one direction for a few meters, do a 180 degree turn and move back. That is valid movement, because it doesn\'t divide the movement around Actions, but it\'s still the same movement.\\n\\nHowever, there are several ways to break this rule. There are plenty of Abilities that allow you to \\"continue your movement\\".\\nAnother way to circumvent this is to get the Attack-Move Feat, which allows you to make Melee Attacks and cast non-offensive Spells \\"while moving\\".\\n\\nBe careful when moving out of the melee attack range of a Unit! If you do, they can make a free attack on you, called an Opportunity Attack!\\n","Other Movement":"Getting up from being Prone requires half of your total Movement. This counts as movement.\\nFalling Prone intentionatley costs no movement but counts as movement.\\n\\nJumping takes away from movement meters, whether vertical or horizontal.\\nIf you decide to jump 1 meters ahead, this still takes 1 meter of movement, as it normally would (the GM might make you roll a Check for succeeding the jump, though).\\nClimbing a 2 meter wall takes 2 meters out of your movement. If you are jumping both horizontally and vertically, you only use the movement for the horizontal movement (e.g. if you jump to a ledge 1 meter away that\'s 1 meter tall, this only uses 1 meter; similarly, if you are jumping to a ledge 3 meters away that\'s 2 meters tall, this takes only 3 meters out of your movement).\\n","Pushing":"Some Abilities \\"push\\" or \\"pull\\" Units (pulling is just pushing in the opposite direction).\\nPushing a Unit does NOT trigger Opportunity Attacks.\\nPushing a Unit does not consume that Unit\'s movement.\\nPushing a Unit does not count as movement for that Unit (for the sake of \\"continuing movement\\").\\n","Initiative":"Initiative determines the order in which Units take their turns in combat.\\n\\nA Player Character\'s Initiative Bonus is equal to (their Dexterity + their Charisma).\\n\\nTo determine turn order, at the start of a combat all Players roll 1d12 and add their Initiative Bonus to it.\\nMonster units don\'t roll,but instead have a fixed Initiative (e.g. 10, 8, 14, etc, depending on the monster).\\nUnits take their turns from the highest Initiative (rolled) to the lowest. The highest result goes first, the lowest goes last.\\n\\nIf there\'s a tie between a Player Unit and an enemy, the Player Unit goes before the monster (the Player Unit takes their turn first, and then the monster).\\nIf there\'s a tie between two Player Units, either can go before (they decide as a group).\\nIf there\'s a tie between two or more enemies, the GM decides which one goes before.\\n","Opportunity Attacks":"When you move out of the melee attack range of another Unit, that Unit can make one attack on you.\\nTo clarify, when a Unit A exits the melee attack range of another Unit B, Unit B can make one attack on Unit A using its Reaction. This is called an Opportunity Attack.\\nThe attack can be with a 2-Handed or 1-Handed Weapon or a Spell, but can\'t use Mana or Abilities that use Actions.\\n\\nBeing pushed by an Ability out of the melee attack range of a Unit does NOT give that Unit an Opportunity Attack.\\n\\nYou _can_ push yourself with an Ability out of the melee attack range like this.\\n","Resistance and Weakness":"Resistance to a certain damage type means you only take 50% of that damage (of the final damage you take; e.g. after subtracting Defense).\\nWeakness to a certain damage type means you take 150% of that damage (of the final damage you take; e.g. after subtracting Defense).\\n","Throwing Weapons":"Some weapons state that they are \\"Optionally Thrown\\".\\nThat means you can throw the weapon and attack with it at range, with the same Stat and damage (unless stated othwerise).\\nThe range of all Thrown weapons is 5 meters.\\n\\nWhen it comes to Training, Thrown Weapons is a Weapon Category in itself.\\nSome weapons are optionally Thrown. If you are Trained in that Weapon Type specifically (e.g. Daggers), you are Trained both in normal attacks with it and in throwing it.\\nIf you are Trained in 1-Handed Weapons but not Trained in Thrown Weapons specifically, you can make normal melee attacks with the weapon, but you are not Trained in throwing it (so, when throwing it, you do not add the Stat).\\nSee the Training rules for more information on how Training works.\\n","Actions":"Player Characters can all make one Action on their turn. This can mean attacking, casting a magic Spell, or anything you can think of that uses both your hands (usually).\\nAn Action is typically associated with doing something with both hands.\\nYou can split an Action into two Half-Actions.\\n\\nThe term \\"Action\\" is just another word for \\"two Half-Actions\\".\\n\\nYou can\'t move, take actions (even if something takes 0 Actions) and then move again. There are, however, Abilities that circumvent this.\\n","Half-Actions":"Half-Actions are exactly what they sound like: using only one hand to do something is a Half-Action, and using both hands to do something is an Action.\\nEssentially, on your turn, you can make 2 Half-Actions (which is the same as an Action).\\nAny Action is just two Half-Actions combined. The term \\"Action\\" is just another word for \\"two Half-Actions\\".\\n\\nYou want to attack with a 2-Handed Swords? That\'s 1 Action, AKA 2 Half-Actions. You use both your hands for this, and since one hand means one Half-Action, that\'s simply the same as one Action.\\n\\nIf you choose to do so, you can even make a Half-Action with one hand, move 4 meters, then make another Half-Action.\\n\\nYou don\'t actually need to keep track of which hand you used already! It doesn\'t matter you already used your right hand to make a Half-Action.\\nHalf-Actions are not tied to one hand or the other in particular.\\n\\nYou CAN make 2 attacks with the same hand using 2 Half-Actions.\\nIf you have a shield and a 1-Handed Sword, yes, you can make 2 attacks with the same hand with the same sword. The game\'s weapons and numbers are balanced around this.\\n\\nWhen your character becomes more advanced, some Abilities will give you more Actions per turn! If you have a total of 2 Actions on your turn, that\'s exactly like having 4 Half-Actions. And you\'d be able to make 4 attacks with the same hand and weapon, or one attack with a 2-Handed Weapon and 2 attacks with 1-Handed Weapon (e.g. Action Surge).\\n","Line of Sight":"If you can see a Unit directly, you have Line of Sight to it.\\n\\nTo clarify, if Unit A can see Unit B with their bare eyes, then Unit A has Line of Sight to Unit B.\\nIf Unit A can see even a little bit of the body of Unit B, then Unit A still has Line of Sight to Unit B (but attacks usually gain the Hard Cover pentalty if you can barely see the target).\\n\\nTo use an Ability, you need Line of Sight to the center target point of where you are casting the Ability.\\n\\nIf playing on a grid, if you target a point, you target the square that point is in. You can\'t normally target square intersections unless the Ability states you can.\\nIf you target a Unit, you must have line of sight to its square.\\nThere is Line of Sight from square A to square B if you can draw a line from any corner of square A to any corner of square B without any other Unit or Obstacle crossing the line.\\nHowever, other Units\' or obstacles\' squares can _intersect_ the line you were drawing if it\'s merely tangential, and does not pass from one side of the line to the other.\\nSee the example below.\\n\\nWithout magical means, Line of Sight is always 2-way. If Unit A has LoS to Unit B, then Unit B also has LoS to Unit A (assuming they look at one another).\\nTransparent solid objects (e.g. windows) do not block Line of Sight, but obviously missiles like arrows and magic bolts can\'t go through them. Apply common sense.\\n","Cooldown":"Some Abilities have a Cooldown.\\nCooldown refers to the time you must wait to use the Ability again.\\nAn Ability\'s Cooldown is represented by the _white hourglass_ icon. If an Ability has no such icon, then it has no Cooldown and can be used as often as you like.\\nA Cooldown of \\"Long Rest\\" means you can use the Ability ONCE, and then can\'t use it again until you finish a Long Rest.\\nA Cooldown mentioning time (e.g. 1 hour, 1 day, etc) always refers to in-game time, not real-life time. 1 day in game can pass instantly, if the Game Master says \\"one day passes\\", for example. Like in a book, movie or video game, time in-game passes from scene to scene, according to the adventure story.\\n","Triggering Abilities":"Some Abilities give you free uses of other Abilities. For example, Clerics get to cast Awe for free, even if it\'s on a Cooldown.\\nWhen an Ability tells you that you can \\"freely cast X ignoring its Cooldown/Cost\\", you can cast that Ability in that moment, whether it\'s on Cooldown or not.\\nIf it\'s not on Cooldown, the Ability does NOT go on Cooldown if you trigger a free cast like this.\\nIf it\'s on Cooldown, the Ability remains on Cooldown.\\n","Combat Grace Period":"For 10 minutes after finishing a combat encounter, all Units who participated are still considered in combat.\\nSome Abilities and game mechanics (e.g. Reserve Health) require you to be out of combat to use.\\nBe on your toes for a while after finishing a fight!\\n","Mounted Combat":"sdsd\\n","Falling Damage":"Falling more 2 meters inflicts 1d6 True damage for every meter (assuming you land on hard ground).\\nE.g. falling 3 meters deals 1d6 damage, falling 4 meters deals 2d6 damage, falling 5 meters deals 3d6 damage, etc.\\nHaving someone fall on you deals the same True damage to you as it does to the faller.\\nThe Game Master might reduce the damage or mitigate it depending what you land on or if you fall onto an enemy with an attack. If you\'re a Game Master, consider halving the fall damage if a Unit falls intentionately on another Unit to attack it.\\n","Knowing and Learning Spells":"All Classes get access to some Generic Abilities. All these Spells are in Spell Lists. Some Classes get access to some Generic Abilities, and some to other Generic Abilities, depending on categories (e.g. Mages get access to all Arcane and Elemental Spells, but no access to Nature Spells).\\nAll Classes can pick a few of these Generic Abilities to Learn for adventuring.\\nTo be able to cast as Spell (AKA to have that Spell) you need to Learn it on a Long Rest. That becomes a Known Spell (you Know that Spell).\\nOnce you Learn a Spell, you Know it. When you see the term \\"Known Ability\\", it always refers to a Generic Ability from the Spell Lists.\\n\\nDifferent Classes have different simple rules for knowing Spells.\\nMages, for example, can know a number of Spells of any kind from the ones that are available to them (e.g. any from the Elemental, Arcane, etc, but none from Nature, Divine, etc).\\nOnce Known, these Spells can be cast as many times as the Cooldown and Cost allows (e.g. as long as you have enough Mana to cast it; explained later).\\nCheck out Mana-based Spellcasting to see how this works.\\n\\nPaladins, for example, have no Mana, but instead have some limits on how many Spells they can know.\\nCheck out Insight-based Spellcasting to see how this works.\\n","Mana-based Spellcasting":"Clerics, Mages, Rogues, Warlocks and Warriors use a system of points called Mana Points.\\nYou have a number of Mana Points that you can spend to cast some Spells, and you regain all Mana Points back when you finish a Long Rest (7 in-game days of non-adventuring).\\n\\nThe amount of Mana a Spell costs to cast is represented by the _blue flame_ icon and the number near it.\\n\\nFor a clear example, let\'s take a look at the Mage Class. As written on the Mage rules page, Mages start with 3 Mana Points (and get 1 more total Mana every Level). Between Long Rests, the Mage can choose to spend these points on casting Spells.\\nEach Spell specifies if and how many Mana Points it costs to cast. If you decide to cast Healing Surge, you must expend one Mana Point and then you are left with 2 Mana Points. It doesn\'t specify that Healing Surge has a Cooldown, so you can do it even twice per turn (since it takes a Half-Action) as long as you have enough Mana Points. If you don\'t have enough Mana Points to cast a Spell, you simply can\'t.\\n\\nWhen building your character, you will have to choose a number of Spells from the ones avaialble to your class - you can\'t have them all, there are dozens in the game! You\'ll pick a few Spells to have at hand. Mages, for example, start out with 4 + your Intelligence Spells. So, if your Intelligence is 3, you must pick 7 out of all the Spells Mages can choose from. These will be all the Spells you will be able to Cast until you finish your next Long Rest (7 in-game days of non-adventuring).\\nThis is explained in further detail later on (see Spell Lists).\\n\\nYou can keep track of your Mana Points on a sheet of paper, with marbles, dice, etc. It is your job to keep track of your Mana Points. Don\'t cheat!\\n","Insight-based Spellcasting":"Druids, Hunters, Paladins and Shamans don\'t have Mana, but instead have Insight.\\n\\nWhen you pick your spells to know (Known Spells), the total Insight required by your Known Spells can\'t exceed your Insight.\\nThe amount of Insight a Spell takes is represented by the _teal eye_ icon and the number near it.\\n\\nInsight Spells don\'t cost Mana, but generally have a Cooldown (depends on each Spell).\\n\\nYou can keep track of your Cooldowns on a sheet of paper or with printed Spell cards.\\n","Main Stat":"The Main Stat is what it sounds like: it is the primary Stat you will use for most things when using Abilities.\\nSome Abilities will say you have to add your Main Stat to its damage.\\n\\nMost Classes allow you to pick which Stat you want your Main Stat to be, usually from Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma.\\n","Counter Check Grade":"This is equal to your Main Stat + 6.\\nNot only players roll Checks, but also enemies. Some Abilities force enemies to roll a Check to avoid it.\\nWhen you make an enemy roll a Check, the Check must be equal or higher than your Counter Check Grade. If they do, they succeed; otherwise, they fail. An Ability tells you explicitly what happens on a success or failure.\\n","Generic Ability":"A Generic Ability refers to an Ability from the Spell Lists (see Spell Lists).\\nThey are called Generic because multiple Classes have access to them.\\n","Spell Lists":"Aside from the Abilities you get from your Race and Class, there are also some Spell Lists you have access to.\\nClasses have access to different Spell Lists and can have a number of Generic Abilities chosen from them.\\n\\nA Spell List is simply a list of Generic Abilities. A set of Generic Abilities grouped together based on their theme and category is called a Spell List (themes like Elemental, Nature, Divine, etc).\\nThe text for every Ability is also in that list. Take a look at this page to familiarize yourself with them.\\n\\nAs of 2023, there are 10 Spell Lists in the game: Bloodshed, Warfare, Elemental, Arcane, Nature, Conjuration, Mysticism, Faith, Eldritch and Divine. Clerics, for example, have access to the Conjuration and Divine Spell Lists.\\nAlso, Clerics can have 4 + their Intelligence Generic Abilities from these lists (Conjuration and Divine).\\nClerics have access to the Conjuration and Divine Spell Lists.\\nThis means that if you are a Cleric (and let\'s say your Intelligence is 2), you can pick 6 Spells from _any_ of those 3 Spell Lists and have them at a ready. Some of those Spells will cost Mana to use, some not.\\n","Known Spells (Mana-based)":"If your class is Mana-based, then your Known Spells are very straightforward.\\nYou can have that many Known Generic Abilities.\\nYou look at the Spell Lists your class has access to (e.g. Clerics have access to the Conjuration and Divine Spell Lists).\\nFrom all those Generic Abilities, you pick a number of them and you have them at a ready. Some of those Spells will cost Mana to use, some not.\\n\\nIf a Spell displays a blue flame icon and a number, then it costs that much Mana to cast it.\\n\\nThese spells represent what your Character has prepared for adventuring. They function exactly like Abilities you have. On Long Rests, you can change what Spells from these Spell Lists your Character knows.\\n","Known Spells (Insight-based)":"If your class is Insight-based, you can know a number of Generic Abilities from your Spell Lists.\\nWhen Learning your Generic Abilities from Spell Lists, the total amount of Insight of your Known Spells must not exceed your character\'s Insight.\\nYou can think of Insight as \\"available memory\\". Some Spells occupy \\"memory\\" (Insight).\\n\\nIf you don\'t have enough Insight left to learn (Know) a Spell, you can\'t learn it.\\nIf a Spell displays a _teal eye_ icon and a number, then it takes up that much Insight to _know_ it. Most Insight Spells have a Long Rest Cooldown.\\n","Relearning Spells":"All Classes can unlearn and re-learn their Generic Abilities when finishing a Long Rest.\\nTalents can also be swapped on Long Rests.\\n","Spell Level Requirements":"Some Abilities require your character to be at least of a certain Level in order to Learn.\\nFor example, if a Spell \\"Requires Level 4\\", your character must be Level 4 or higher to be able to Learn that Ability.\\n","Free Spells":"You will see that some Generic Spells have no cost and no cooldown.\\nThe only \'cost\' of these Spells is a space in your Known Spells.\\nThese Spells can\'t be freely used during a Long Rest, and then swapped. Your Spells finish changing when you finish a Long Rest. If you decide to adventure with Conjure Ammo, you can\'t cast it and then immediately change it to another Spell and start adventuring with 100 conjured arrows.\\nAs a general rule of thumb, the effect of most free Spells dissipates immediately if you ever no longer Know that Spell. A Game Master might allow exceptions to this.\\n","Dice calculations":"To denote multiple dice of the same type rolled at the same time, you will see a number in front of the \\"d\\", like \\"2d4\\" or \\"5d6\\". That simply means \\"two 4-sided dice\\" or \\"five 6-sided dice\\". If something tells you to roll \\"5d6\\", roll five 6-sided dice all at the same time, and sum up the result!\\nSometimes, you will also need to roll multiple dice of multiple types, like \\"2d8 + 3d12\\". That means you must roll two 8-sided dice and three 12-sided dice all at the same time and sum up the result.\\nYou might also see other \\"modifiers\\" to dice rolls, such as \\"+ 3\\" or \\"- 1\\". That simply means you add 3 to the total number, or subtract 1 from the total number. So, such an example might be \\"2d6 + 2\\" or \\"2d4 + 3d10 - 5\\". Roll all those dice and add or subtract the number mentioned.\\nIn other cases, you will see other modifiers like \\"+ your Might\\" or \\"+ your Dexterity\\". These are usually self explanatory - they refer to adding your character\'s Might or your character\'s Dexterity to the final number. Such an example might be \\"2d6 + your Might\\". In this case, you roll 2d6 and add your character\'s Might to the final result.\\n","Checks":"To pass a Check, your rolled total must be equal or higher than the required number.\\n","Leveling Up":"In Call of Heroes, there are 10 Player Character Levels (from 1 to 10). Most characters start as Level 1 characters and progress level by level towards Level 10.\\nEach Level, a character gains some Reserve Health (based on Class) and extra resources, like maximum Mana or Insight, extra available Spells, Feats, Stats, etc.\\nEvery 2 Levels, characters also gain a Talent from their Class - these are usually strong Abilities that define how you play your character.\\n\\nThere are 2 ways in which PC\'s can level up: either through gaining Experience from killing monsters, completing tasks and puzzles, roleplaying, etc _or_ by milestones set by the Game Master. It is up to each GM to use a system that fits their own adventure\\n\\nThe milestone system is the recommended system for most adventures, as it\'s easier to work with and more thematic.\\nIf you are using the milestone system, the Game Master will simply decide that all players level up when the GM thinks the time is right. This is generally after a boss fight or after an important story event.\\nIn the milestone system, there are no Experience Points.\\n\\nLeveling up can\'t happen during combat, but it is delayed to after combat.\\nUpon Leveling Up, the Player Characters benefit instantly from a Long Rest (e.g. heal to full Health, regain Mana, reset Cooldowns, etc).\\nAs a variant rule, the Game Master can decide to not give the players a free Long Rest when Leveling up.\\n","The Experience System":"In the Experience system, a Player needs an amount of Experience Points to Level Up. Each Player has a separate track of Experience Points, but it is recommended that Game Masters award Experience Points equally, so that all players Level Up at the same time.\\nOnce a player Levels Up their character, their Experience Points are spent, but they keep extra Experience they didn\'t spend. For example, if a Player has 500 Experience Points and they need 450 to Level Up, they Level Up and they keep 50 Experience. After that, they need to \\"fill up the Experience meter\\" again to Level Up.\\n\\nThe amount of Experience Points required to Level Up to the next level is equal to (next level) * 100. To Level Up from Level 1 to Level 2, you need 200 Experience Points. Then, to Level up from Level 2 to Level 3, you need 300 more Experience Points. And so on.\\n\\nNote: If you\'re coming from other RPG\'s, note that how much Experience you need to get from a Level to another does NOT refer to ALL the Experience your character has amassed so far. From Level 1 to 2, you need 200 Experience. And from Level 2 to 3 you need 300 _more_ Experience. The total amount of Experience needed for you to be Level 3 is 500. So, no, you obviously don\'t need just 100 Experience to Level up every time.\\n","Distributing Experience":"When the players as a group defeat an enemy that awards Experience, distribute that Experience evenly among all players who took part.\\nIf a monster was worth 200 Experience and there are 4 party members, then each party member gets 50 Experience. Monsters don\'t have levels in CoH, but rather each monster awards experience.\\n\\nThe Game Master will usually announce how much Experience an encounter was worth. The GM can also award Experience for other tasks, such as getting out of a situation, solving puzzles, completing a part of the storyline, etc.\\n","LevelUpBonusesDescription (Insight-based)":"When you level up (e.g. Level 1 to Level 2), you gain some Health (depending on your Class), you can Know one more Spell from your allowed Spell Lists and get +1 total available Insight.\\nDepending on your Level, you also gain something else (see the Level Up rewards table).\\n\\nOnce you reach Level 4, you unlock the Action Surge Ability.\\n","LevelUpBonusesDescription (Mana-based)":"When you level up (e.g. Level 1 to Level 2), you gain some Health (depending on your Class) and you can Know one more Spell from your allowed Spell Lists.\\nYou gain 1 more Mana per Long Rest (raises your maximum number of Mana points).\\nDepending on your Level, you also gain something else (see the table on the left).\\n\\nOnce you reach Level 4, you unlock the Action Surge Ability.\\n","LevelUpBonusesDescription (Special Mana-based)":"When you level up (e.g. Level 1 to Level 2), you gain some Health (depending on your Class) and you can Know one more Spell from your allowed Spell Lists.\\nUnlike regular Mana-based Classes, Warlocks don\'t gain a Mana point every Level, but rather every 3 Levels (check the table to see when you get extra Mana!).\\nDepending on your Level, you also gain something else (see the table on the left).\\n\\nOnce you reach Level 4, you unlock the Action Surge Ability.\\n","Long Resting":"Player Characters can decide to make a Long Rest (as a group).\\n\\nA Long Rest means 7 in-game days of non-adventuring and resting in a safe space. During this time, the Player Characters can do anything that\'s non-combat, doesn\'t cost Mana or Insight, etc.\\nNote that Long Rests must be made in safe environments where you can safely let your guard down - you can\'t Long Rest inside a dungeon, forest camp, enemy keep, etc.\\n\\nUpon finishing a Long Rest, all Player Characters restore all Health and Reserve Health, Mana and most Ability Cooldowns.\\n\\nIf a Long Rest is interrupted (e.g. by combat), the Long Rest must be started over.\\n\\nIf an Ability has a Cooldown longer than 24 Hours, it does not reset.\\n","Reserve Health Pool":"Equal to half of your Maximum Health, without buffs, rounded down.\\n\\nReserve Health is, well, Health that you have in reserves. When not in combat, you can instantly transfer Health from your Reserve Health to your regular Health (e.g. take points from your Reserve Health to heal your Health for the same amount).\\nHealing from your Reserve Health can only be done 10 minutes after a combat encounter ends.\\n","Exhaustion":"An Exhausted Unit has halved movement, has only one Half-Action per turn (is Dazed) and can\'t use Abilities that cost Mana or Insight.\\nExhaustion is cause by going more than 24 hours without sleep, by magical effects or by overdosing on potions.\\nExhaustion is cured upon sleeping for 8 hours straight.\\n"}');function mn(){var e=fe(),t=decodeURIComponent(e.hash).substring(1);return(0,Oe.jsxs)(wt,{children:[(0,Oe.jsx)(ft,{children:t}),(0,Oe.jsx)("p",{children:dn[t]}),"Line of Sight"==t&&(0,Oe.jsxs)(dt,{children:[(0,Oe.jsx)(mt,{children:(0,Oe.jsx)("img",{style:{width:"100%"},src:"/Rules/LineOfSightWall.png"})}),(0,Oe.jsx)(mt,{children:(0,Oe.jsx)("img",{style:{width:"100%"},src:"/Rules/LineOfSightNo.png"})})]})]})}var fn=JSON.parse('{"Before Adventuring":"You have not started adventuring yet.

Or perhaps other people as strong as you, seeking your anihilation.\\n","Level 9":"Level 9 is approaching the pinnacle of your grand powers.\\nYou seek immortality or gods.

The languages your character speaks can be used for being able to communicate with another person, reading things in that language, or you might even be able to use your known language to impress someone and get a better offer on a quest\'s reward!\\n","Languages in Custom Worlds":"If your Game Master has a custom world where the languages are different, ask them what counts as a Common Language, Wild Language, etc.\\nAs a general rule of thumb, you should also ask if the languages you want to know even exist in the world you\'re playing in, or if they are relevant (e.g. if you speak Goblan but there are no goblins on this continent, then there\'s no point in knowing Goblan).\\n","Common Languages":"Common Languages are the most widely spoken languages by societies in the world you\'re playing in.\\nUsually, everyone speaks Common (English). It\'s recommended that all party members can speak the same language, so they can easily understand eachother in-game.\\n\\nThe standard Common Languages are:\\n- Common\\n- Dwarvish\\n- Elvish\\n","Wild Languages":"Wild Languages are languages spoken by more tribal societies, or less common languages from around the world.\\n\\nThe standard Wild Languages are:\\n- Orcish\\n- Goblan\\n- Sylvan (spoken by some forest-dwelling creatures, like Dryads)\\n- Gian\\n- Undran (spoken by underground societies, deep within the caves of the underdark)\\n","Higher Languages":"Higher Languages are languages spoken by outworldly entities, like angels, demons or alien beings.\\nInfernal is the language of demons, Celestial - the language of angels, Ancian - an old language long forgotten.\\nAbyssal is a non-spoken language, used in communication by old gods, aberrations or invasive aliens. Abyssal is a telepathic language transmitting flashes of emotions or abstract images or sounds into the mind of another individual. Only those trained in Abyssal can interpret/understand Abyssal, and \'speaking\' Abyssal requires a form of telepathy magic.\\nOften times, when the entity \'whispers\' to an individual and they feel anxiety or fear, it\'s simply a failure of communication/interpretation of Abyssal (though sometimes, that\'s exactly the point).\\n\\nThe standard Higher Languages are:\\n- Infernal (demons)\\n- Celestial (angels)\\n- Ancian (old common)\\n- Abyssal (non-spoken language of the eldritch)\\n","Elemental Languages":"Elemental Languages are used by elementals or element spirits to convey information.\\nUsually, these are non-spoken languages. For example, Ignan might transmit information through the shape of flames, or Aquan through the waves of water.\\n\\nThe standard Elemental Languages are:\\n- Terran\\n- Ignan\\n- Aquan\\n- Airan\\n","Special Languages":"Special Languages are a special type of communication used by very specific individuals.\\nThieves\' Cant is not exactly a language, but a way to carry out private conversations in public by using code words and phrases with double meaning, such that what you say is indistinguishable from a normal conversation. Thieves\' Cant also has a written version; thieves, rogues and streetspeople might use certain markings on buildings and roads to transmit to others messages like \\"danger\\" or \\"hidden path\\"; these markings are indistinguishable from random scratches to the unaware.\\nDruidic is the art of conveying information through wind, soil, bark, etc. Similar to the written version of Thieves\' Cant, Druidic is indistinguishable from regular nature, but it contains messages meant for other druids through means like the way bark is growing on a tree, unusual moss formations, unusual winds, etc. These often convey messages like \\"monster lair\\", \\"hidden path\\", \\"healing plants ahead\\", etc.\\nDraconic is the language of Dragons and Dragonborn, manifested through shouts, breath, body language and short words. This language comes naturally to Dragons and Dragonborn (akin to dogs barking). Some say the power of Draconic can be harnessed to unleash powerful magic. Draconic can be spoken by non-dragons, but never properly, as non-dragons lack dragon breath and the instincts necessary to manifest it perfectly. There exists a version of written Draconic, at the sight of which dragons and Dragonborn can feel the language as if it were spoken. Draconic is usually not written with words, but rather with pictograms or symbols that aim to directly stir an emotion when seen by a Dragonborn or dragon.\\n\\nThe standard Special Languages are:\\n- Thieves\' Cant\\n- Druidic (wind, trees, etc)\\n- Draconic (shouts, breath, short words); not able to be spoken properly by non-dragons"}');function vn(){var e=Object.keys(yn);return(0,Oe.jsx)(wt,{title:"Languages",children:e.map((function(e){return(0,Oe.jsxs)("div",{children:[(0,Oe.jsx)(PageH3,{children:e}),(0,Oe.jsx)("p",{children:yn[e]})]})}))})}var bn=function(){return(0,Oe.jsxs)(un,{type:"info",columns:["Level","You Get..."],children:[(0,Oe.jsxs)("tr",{children:[(0,Oe.jsx)("td",{children:"Level 1"}),(0,Oe.jsx)("td",{children:"-"})]}),(0,Oe.jsxs)("tr",{children:[(0,Oe.jsx)("td",{children:"Level 2"}),(0,Oe.jsx)("td",{children:"Talent from your Specialization (Tier 1)"})]}),(0,Oe.jsxs)("tr",{children:[(0,Oe.jsx)("td",{children:"Level 3"}),(0,Oe.jsxs)("td",{children:["+1 in any Stat",(0,Oe.jsx)("br",{}),"1 Weapon Training",(0,Oe.jsx)("br",{}),"+1 Feat"]})]}),(0,Oe.jsxs)("tr",{children:[(0,Oe.jsx)("td",{children:"Level 4"}),(0,Oe.jsx)("td",{children:"Talent from your Specialization (Tier 2)"})]}),(0,Oe.jsxs)("tr",{children:[(0,Oe.jsx)("td",{children:"Level 5"}),(0,Oe.jsx)("td",{children:"Action Surge (see below)"})]}),(0,Oe.jsxs)("tr",{children:[(0,Oe.jsx)("td",{children:"Level 6"}),(0,Oe.jsx)("td",{children:"Talent from your Specialization (Tier 3)"})]}),(0,Oe.jsxs)("tr",{children:[(0,Oe.jsx)("td",{children:"Level 7"}),(0,Oe.jsxs)("td",{children:["+1 in any Stat",(0,Oe.jsx)("br",{}),"1 Weapon Training",(0,Oe.jsx)("br",{}),"+1 Feat"]})]}),(0,Oe.jsxs)("tr",{children:[(0,Oe.jsx)("td",{children:"Level 8"}),(0,Oe.jsx)("td",{children:"Talent from your Specialization (Tier 4)"})]}),(0,Oe.jsxs)("tr",{children:[(0,Oe.jsx)("td",{children:"Level 9"}),(0,Oe.jsx)("td",{children:"Pick one more Talent from either Tier 2 or Tier 4.

Clal of Heroes can be seen as a better alternative to Dungeons and Dragons, with more player-friendly (and clearly written) rules, mechanics that area easier to understand, more intriguing options and digitally modern. Described directly, it\'s cleverly simple, modern and plainly cool! Like the games it draw inspiration from, Call of Heroes is a combat-oriented game. While optional, fighting is a key part of Call of Heroes. It is one aspect that Call of Heroes excels at over its alternatives: combat is faster, more dynamic and more interesting overall, with simpler rules, but more possibilities for strategies and tactics. Combat usually happens on a grid of squares, with every player and monster taking turns to move, attack and cast magic spells!\\nUnlike RPG video games (World of Warcraft, Skyrim, etc), in tabletop RPG\'s, a Game Master can create any world and story they want (based on some rules) and players can essentially do anything they want in that world or story, without being limited to narrow dialogue options or only certain mechanics.\\nIn a tabletop RPG, the players can do _anything_ (or at least try)! It becomes the Game Master\'s responsibility to narrate what happens, play the role of non-player characters and monsters, come up with fair encounters and make the experience fun for the players. Having fun is the most important!\\nThe Game Master is not the player\'s enemy - it is the narrator, referee and, usually, host of the game; their goal is to provide exciting experiences and stories for the players and keep the game balanced and impartial.\\n\\nA tabletop RPG is not constrained by graphics. A lot of people play on a table, with grids/mats and miniatures as characters (like in a board game). But this is not entirely necessary! Many people play without any visual aid at all, and it\'s all \\"theater of the mind\\"!\\nNowadays, there are online platforms to play tabletop RPG\'s. These offer the Game Master tools for creating maps, \\"tokens\\" that represent player characters and enemies (like 2D sprites or even 3D models that can be placed on the map) and even playing environmental music.\\nAnd like in a board game, there are rules for both players and the Game Master to ensure that the game is fair and fun for everyone. Every player\'s character must have strengths and weaknesses.\\n\\nWhen players want to do something, like shooting a bow or negotiating with an NPC, the result is often determined by rolling dice.\\n","How do groups work?":"If you want to play, sometimes it\'s as easy as creating a character outside of a game, finding a group to play with via an online platform and just joining the game.\\nHowever, tabletop RPG\'s can be so much more than just a one-time experience!\\n\\nMany GM\'s choose to run \'campaigns\', which is a series of game sessions that continue from one play session to another, and expand into an overarching story and develop the players\' characters\' personalities and powers.\\nThus, if you want it to be a more intricate experience, you should find a group that fits you; make sure you get on well with everyone else and everyone is on the same page when it comes to playing.\\n\\nEach GM is different. A GM might run a story based on the Lord of the Rings books or in some made up world. Some GM\'s have different styles of playing - some are more focused on telling a story, others are more focused on giving the players options. Some are friendly, some... less so.\\nUltimately, just like finding a group to play board games with, you all should have roughly the same expectations and mindset. Some games are more relaxed, drinking and eating pizza. Some are more intense and take things seriously. If you find a group, make sure you ask what kind of group they are.\\n\\nMost groups have one Game Master and between 3 and 6 other players who play as individual characters.\\nThe recommended sweet spot for Call of Heroes is one Game Master and 4 to 5 other players.\\n\\nA play session can last as long as the group desires. Usually, you should dedicate at least 1:30 to 2 hours to a play session. A lot of players find they want to keep going after that, since time flies fast when you\'re having fun and making progress through the story!\\n","How is it different from a board game?":"A board game is limited by its physical pieces (cards, miniatures, board, etc).\\nA tabletop RPG does not have to be limited by anything.\\nWhen you buy a board game, you expect to be able to play the whole game with everything that comes in the box.\\nHowever, to play Call of Heroes, you don\'t need anything from the box. In fact, you don\'t even need to buy anything! Don\'t want to buy mats or print out maps? Use sheets of paper and draw the board on them directly. Don\'t have miniatures? Use pretzels and bottle caps (sounds stupid, but it works; and we\'re also pretty sure you can find better replacements for them as well).\\nThere is no stigma in the tabletop roleplaying community for improvizing your own gaming set. In fact, it\'s encouraged! Many people like making terrain and props to use in their tabletop games.\\n","What is a story or adventure like?":"Slay monsters, get treasure\\nThe 3 pillars (33% each)\\n","What should I buy to get started?":"Nothing.\\nAll you need to play are the rules and, of course, a group of people.\\nAll the rules for the players are free and accessible online on this website.\\nWe do, though, recommend you get a set of D&D Dice (it contains a 4-sided die, 6-sided die, 8-sided die, 10-sided die, 12-sided die and 20-sided die). Rolling dice is a very fun aspect of tabletop RPG\'s! However, if you don\'t have access to a set of dice, there are plenty mobile or online apps that simulate dice rolling. You should be able to buy a generic set of such dice for a maximum of $10 at a gaming store (as of 2022).\\n","How do I get started?":"It might be daunting to learn all the rules by yourself. But fret not; since Call of Heroes is mainly inspired by Dungeons and Dragons, you fill find a lot of people who play D&D and will be willing to try CoH with you!\\nThe easiest way to get started is to find someone who already knows how to play Call of Heroes and ask to join their game, or ask them to host a game for you and some other friends.\\nIf you want to try Call of Heroes specifically and you have experience with Dungeons and Dragons (5th edition or One D&D), see the page \\"D&D to CoH transition guide\\". It will provide you an easy introduction to Call of Heroes from a D&D perspective.\\nIf you never played a tabletop RPG but you have friends who have played Dungeons and Dragons, send them a link to the \\"D&D to CoH transition guide\\" page!\\nIf you decide to play online, there are several platforms for playing Call of Heroes that simulate real life tables with miniatures, dice, music, etc. As of 2023, the most popular such platform is Roll20 (https://roll20.net). It is free for all players and Game Masters alike and supports many roleplaying games, including Call of Heroes.\\n","Learning the Rules":"Feel free to follow this guide to learn how to play the game. Both in the book and on the official website, you will find clarifications for each and every rule. When in doubt, search it up on the website or consult the table of contents of the book for that rule.\\nAside from this written guide, there is also a video guide for both new and experienced roleplayers on our official YouTube channel or on the official Call of Heroes website.\\n\\nTo be a player in a game, you need a Character! Don\'t worry about creating a character for now.\\nFor the rest of this guide, assume you are playing as a short and skinny, sneaky Gnome. That is your character! We\'ll name him Don. Yes, in this story, you are Don.\\n","Checking the Rules":"If you ever find something ambiguous, there is probably a rule for it on the official website. Just search the exact phrase or words that are unclear and you will most likely find an explanation!\\n","Dice":"Before we begin, you need to know about dice.\\nDice rolling is a core component of Call of Heroes. Whatever you want to do, it is likely you will need to roll a die for it to determine if you succeed or fail, either as a Player Character or as an NPC or monster.\\nIn the world of tabletop roleplaying, there exists one standard set of \\"polyhedral\\" dice - whether they are Dungeons and Dragons dice or Pathfinder dice, they are all the same and they all work.\\nA set of such dice contains 7 special dice: a 4-sided die, a 6-sided die, an 8-sided die, two 10-sided dice, a 12-sided die and a 20-sided die. Only one such set will suffice for playing Call of Heroes to its full extent, though the more dice you have, the merrier!\\nEach of these dice contains one number on each face: the 4-sided die goes from 1 to 4, the 6-sided die (normal die) goes from 1 to 6, and so on.\\nWherever you live, you can buy a set of roleplaying dice for less than $10 (as of 2023), usually at a board game shop or a gaming store, or, if you can\'t find any, you can order them online. If you can\'t afford that, there are plenty of mobile dice simulators. Just search \\"dice\\" on your mobile application store and there should be several free applications that mimick dice rolling!\\nIf you decide to play online and not at a real table, however, you don\'t need to buy dice and can just use online dice rolling simulators. There are many platforms for online roleplaying and they all incorporate dice rolling simulators.\\n","Dice notation and calculations":"Whenever you see a notation like \\"d4\\", \\"d6\\", \\"d8\\", etc, these mean \\"4-sided die\\", \\"6-sided die\\", \\"8-sided die\\", etc.\\nSo, a die with 4 sides is called a \\"d4\\", a die with 6 sides is called a \\"d6\\", etc. \\nIf you see \\"d4\\", that means you\'re supposed to roll a 4-sided die and take that result.\\nIf you see \\"d6\\", that means you\'re supposed to roll a 6-sided die and take that result. And so on and so forth.\\n\\nIf you are ever in doubt about what a certain dice notation means, you can ask your other team mates or the Game Master - one of them will surely know!\\n\\nCall of Heroes is a \\"d12 system\\", unlike Dungeons and Dragons and Pathfinder, which are \\"d20 systems\\". This simply means that you will use the d12 die for _a lot_ of things in Call of Heroes. The 12-sided die will be your best friend while playing Call of Heroes, so learn which one it is! Frankly, we believe it is also the prettiest die of them all! Just look at that perfect shape... beautiful!\\n","How does it play out?":"Here is how a standard game session plays out:\\nWhen everyone sits down at the table and is ready to start playing, the Game Master will start telling you how the story begins. This is usually narration in the 2nd person, addressing you all at the same time.\\n\\"You are all sitting around a camp fire, deep in the woods. It is a cool Autumn day and the sky is clear of clouds. You are surrounded by thick shrubbery and your shadows dance as the flame flickers\\".\\nYou and your fellow players can choose to do, well, anything, at any point during the story. However, you should refrain from interrupting the Game Master while they are talking. Generally, you can ask the Game Master for any more information you think you need, and the Game Master might or might not tell you, depending on the story they are telling.\\nHowever, a clear sign that you _can_ do something is if the Game Master says \\"what do you do?\\". That is your time to shine as a team.\\n\\"Suddenly, a bear appears out of the thicket. What do you do?\\"\\nAnd there is no correct answer. You, together, as a team, decide what you want to do. Do you want to scare off the bear? Do you run? Do you hide? Do you want to shoot an arrow at it? Do you want to cast a magic spell at it and set it on fire? Do you want to do... nothing? Of course, each of you can do something different if you have different opinions on what the best course of action is, but, fundamentally, you are all in this together.\\nIf you want to do something, simply say it out loud! \\"I want to hide from the bear\\" or, more directly, \\"I hide from the bear\\" (generally, when a player says \\"I\\" or \\"Me\\", they refer to their character; if you don\'t feel comfortable using \\"I\\", use \\"my character\\", like \\"My character wants to hide\\" or \\"I want my character to hide\\"). Or, you could ask the Game Master clarification questions like \\"Does my character know the bear\'s intentions?\\" or \\"Do I see other bears in the darkness?\\". Situations might hide secrets!\\nThis repeats on and on: the Game Master describes a situation, and you all decide how to resolve that situation. Usually, the Game Master has prepared in advance your possibilities, but, a lot of the time, the Game Master\'s job is to improvise and know how to deal with whatever the players decide they want to do. Being a good GM takes a lot of practice and time invested, but it is worth it!\\n\\nNormally, there is no \\"turn order\\" in which players do things. Anyone can do anything at any point in time. Nonetheless, the GM might impose an order in which each player can say what they want to do, to keep everything organized.\\nHowever, there _is_ a turn order when it comes to fighting! If the players engage in a battle to the death, there will be an order in which everyone can say what they want to do! But more on that later.\\nFor now, we\'re concerned with this bear that\'s appeared near our campfire.\\n\\nYou want to _do something_. Will you succeed?\\n","Checks":"So, you want to _do something. How do you determine if your character succeeds or fails at it?\\nWhenever you (your character) want to do something that requires some effort, that will usually require you to make roll Check.\\nA Check is a d12 die roll - you roll a 12-sided die to determine how well you do. If you get a 1, 2 or 3, that is usually pretty bad, while 10, 11 or 12 are pretty good numbers and have a higher chance to succeed.\\nYou as the player don\'t know how high you have to roll to succeed - the Game Master knows it, though, and you must trust that they are playing it fairly.\\nWhether you fail or succeed, the Game Master will let you know what happens! The GM might say \\"You try to hide behind a tree, but the bear\'s keen sense of smell detects where you are\\" if you fail, or \\"You successfully hide behind a tree, without the bear noticing\\" if you succeed.\\nWhenever not sure what you can do, ask the GM!\\n\\nHowever, how well you do is not all completely random. Naturally, a short, skinny Gnome should be better at hiding than most, and a bulky barbarian should normally be better at lifting heavy objects than most.\\nThat is where your character\'s stats come in!\\n","Stats":"Each Character\'s has 5 Stats: Might, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma.\\nTogether, they represent your Character\'s capabilities. When you create your character, each of them will range from -1 to 3, but they are generally balanced so you have some higher Stats and some lower Stats.\\nStats are just some numbers that represent how good your character is at that particular thing. Having -1 in a Stat means you are below average at that (yikes!), having 0 or 1 in a Stat means you (your character) are average and having 2 or 3 means you are above average or great at it!\\n\\nMight refers to how physically strong the character is and how much physical effort and pain the character can endure. If you have 0 Might, it means your character is pretty average at physical strength.\\nDexterity refers to how agile the character is, how good its reflexes are, how well it can maintain balance, etc. If you have 3 Dexterity, you are _really_ agile, and really good at those things!\\nIntelligence refers to how many things the character knows, how well it does with magic and how good their memory is. If you have -1 Intelligence, it means the character is (no offense) fairly dumb.\\nWisdom refers to how good your intuition and senses are and how strong your willpower is. A 1 in Wisdom means you have average senses and willpower.\\nCharimsa refers to how well you do in social situations, both verbally and with body language. A 2 in Charisma means you are a good communicator and people usually like you!\\n","Checks Continued":"Let\'s get back to Checks. Whenever you make a Check, you add one of the appropriate Stats to the d12 roll.\\nSo, if you want to hide, that fits with the Dexterity Stat, so you roll a d12 and add your Dexterity to that. If you are the short, skinny and sneaky Gnome and your Dexterity is 3, you roll a d12 and add 3 to the result. That is the result of your Check.\\nThe Game Master will usually tell you what Stat to use for a certain Check.\\n\\nOnly the Game Master knows how high the result of your Check has to be to succeed, but, as a general rule of thumb, most medium to difficult tasks will require you to get at least a 10 (with the d12 + the Stat).\\n\\nThose are all the rules for regular Checks! But if you are a maths-savy person, you will notice that even if you have the highest number in a Stat, that is still only a 50% chance to succeed. So, to combat this, there are plenty of special Abilities that allow you to add more numbers to Checks - in some special cases, you can get even up to +15 to Checks!\\nDon\'t worry about it for now. Call of Heroes is very straight-forward. If you can add more numbers to a Check, you will see it explicitly written on something your Character can do.\\nBut there are no other general rules for Checks. Unless you see an exception explicitly written on your Character\'s sheet, that\'s all you need to know for Checks!\\n","Combat":"If you decide to engage in combat (or the enemies ambush you), the way things play out change slightly.\\nTactical combat is a large part of what makes Call of Heroes unique and an improvement over other systems.\\nIn combat, you can no longer make decisions whever you want, but you have to take them on your turn. Combat in all RPG\'s play more similarly to a board game in which you have more freedom.\\nFirst things first, let\'s talk about the turn order.\\n","Turn order (and Initiative)":"Turn order is determined by rolling a d12 and taking turns in order from the highest to the lowest.\\n\\nLet\'s say you are 4 players, and are ambushed by 3 bears. You can\'t just say \\"I shoot an arrow at the bear\\" and do it immediately. You must respect the turn order, because maybe the bears are faster than you!\\nBut how do you determine the order in which everyone acts? By rolling a d12, of course!\\n\\nTo determine combat turn order, every player rolls for \\"Initiative\\", meaning you roll a d12 and add your Dexterity and your Charisma to the roll.\\nSince your Dexterity is 3 and your Charisma is 2 (as the short sneaky Gnome that you are), that means you roll a d12 and add 5 to the result. That\'s pretty good!\\n\\nEveryone takes their turn in order of how high they rolled. Whoever rolled the highest goes first.\\nIn Call of Heroes, monsters and non-placed characters don\'t roll for Initiative, but instead just have a number. Bears, for example, have 10 Initiative by default.\\n\\nSo, if you roll above 10, you go before the bears.\\nSince bears all have the same initiative, they take their turns one by one, one after another (or, if the GM decides so, they could take their turns all at the same time).\\n\\nAfter everyone rolls for Initiative, it\'s time to fight (in order of initiative).\\nEveryone (and the bears) take turns to do what they want to do, and then again and again until combat is over (AKA all enemis die, all players die, you run away, you negotiate a truce, etc).\\n","Health":"How much you can resist in combat is determined by your Health Points. Every living thing in the game has Health Point (or just Health, or HP).\\nYou as a character have a set amount of Health Points determined by how you created your character.\\n\\nWhenever you take Damage, you subtract that many points from your current Health Points.\\nIf someone reaches 0 or less Health Points, they die (or at least fall incapacitated).\\nProtect these Health Points as best you can, because they represent your life!\\n\\nAs the sneaky Gnome you are, let\'s say you have a total of 12 Health Points.\\nDuring your day of adventuring, you will undoubtedly fight enemies, fall in traps and hurt yourself.\\nWhenever that happens, you will lose some of your Health Points.\\n\\nYou regain all of your lost Health Points back when your character takes a 7-day break from adventuring in-game; this is called a Long Rest.\\nLong Rests have nothing to do with real world time. You can just say \\"Let\'s take a Long Rest\\" and the Game Master might just say \\"Done, 7 days have passed.\\".\\n\\nDuring the gaming session, you will have to keep track yourself of how many Health Points you have, either on a sheet of paper or in a document. Don\'t cheat!\\nYour total amount of Health is calculated when you create your character; we\'ll get into that a bit later.\\n","Your Turn":"When it\'s your turn in combat, you can A) Move and B) use your Action (in any order).\\nEveryone can take an Action in combat and Move. Let\'s begin with moving.\\n","Moving":"When you decide to move, you can run a few meters in any direction, spending on your Speed.\\nAs a Gnome, your Speed is 4 meters per turn (the Speed of all Gnomes is 4 meters per turn). That means you can run 4 meters once per turn.\\n4 meters is just the maximum number of total meters you can move. You can move 2 meters up and 2 meters to the left, or move only 3 meters in any direction, or not move at all! It\'s up to you how you move.\\n","Actions":"Player Characters can all make one Action on their turn. This can mean attacking, casting a magic Spell, or anything you can think of that uses your hands (usually).\\n\\nThe most standard way to take your turn is to move once and then attack once (or attack and then move).\\nIf you want to do something that uses both hands, that\'s an Action.\\nBut what if you want to do something different with each hand? That\'s where Half-Actions come in.\\n","Half-Actions":"Half-Actions are exactly what they sound like: using only one hand to do something is a Half-Action, and using both hands to do something is an Action.\\nEssentially, on your turn, you can make 2 Half-Actions (which is the same as an Action).\\nAny Action is just two Half-Actions combined. You want to attack with a 2-Handed Swords? That\'s 1 Action, AKA 2 Half-Actions. You use both your hands for this, and since one hand means one Half-Action, that\'s simply the same as one Action.\\nThe term \\"Action\\" is just another word for \\"two Half-Actions\\".\\n\\nIf you choose to do so, you can even make a Half-Action with one hand, move 4 meters, then make another Half-Action.\\n\\nBut it gets better! You don\'t actually need to keep track of which hand you used already! It doesn\'t matter you already used your right hand to make a Half-Action.\\nOn your turn, you have 2 Half-Actions. Period. They are not tied to one hand or the other in particular. You want to make 2 Half-Actions with the same hand? You are free to do so!\\nIf you have a shield and a 1-Handed Sword, yes, you can make 2 attacks with the same hand with the same sword. But don\'t worry about the numbers; the game is balanced around this.\\n\\nIn the future, when your character becomes more advanced, some Abilities will give you more Actions per turn! If you have a total of 2 Actions on your turn, that\'s exactly like having 4 Half-Actions. And you\'d be able to make 4 attacks with the same hand and weapon, or one attack with a 2-Handed Weapon and 2 attacks with 1-Handed Weapon. You\'re free to do whatever you want with your hands!\\n","Attacking, Weapons and Defense":"When you attack with a weapon, you roll the weapon\'s dice and subtract the enemy\'s Defense.\\n\\nEvery weapon in the game does a certain amount of damage and all weapons can be found on the Weapons page.\\nEvery weapon also benefits from either your Might or your Dexterity.\\nFor example, a Club deals 1d8 Damage and uses the Might Stat. So, whenever you attack with the Club, the damage done by that attack is 1d8 + your Might. If you are the sneaky, slim Gnome, that means 1d8 - 1, which is not very good.\\nThe Dagger, however, deals 1d6 + 1 damage and uses Dexterity. Thus, if you are the sneaky Gnome, the damage will be 1d6 + 4, which is much better!\\n\\nYou roll the damage, and the enemy subtracts the damage you deal from their Health Points. Your job is to get them to 0 or less Health.\\n\\nHowever, every character and monster has another number called Defense. Whenever it is attacked, their Defense reduces the amount of damage they take by that amount.\\nFor example, if you attack the Bear and the attack would deal 7 damage, the Bear does not just lose 7 Health, but instead subtracts its Defense from the attack.\\nBears\' Defense is 4, so, whevener the Bear is attacked, it reduces all incoming damage by 4. 7 becomes 3. That\'s the final amount of damage the Bear takes.\\n\\nTo conclude, the final damage of your attack is: (Weapon Damage) + (your Might or Dexterity) - (enemy Defense).\\nIn this particular case with you being the Gnome and the enemy being the Bear, the total damage is (1d6 + 1) + (3) - (4).\\n\\nNo matter if you use a 1-Handed Weapon (with Half-Actions) or a 2-Handed Weapon (with Actions), the formula is the same. Even if you use both hands, the formula doesn\'t change. It\'s always the same.\\n\\nRemember the magic formula for attacking: Weapon + Stat - Defense.\\n\\nThat\'s pretty much it for attacking! The next section will go a bit more into detail about some other tips and tricks for combat!\\n","Regaining Health":"Inherit Reserve Health Pool from Rules","Why Your Positioning Matters":"While on paper combat seems like a randomness fest, there are many other things that influence combat.\\nOne of the most important is positioning. If you shoot an arrow at an enemy behind a wall, it will obviously not be as efficient as if the enemy was standing in an open field.\\nIf you fall from above onto an enemy, that\'s more effective than just attacking normally.\\nThere is even a bonus for doing a cool stunt!\\n\\nDuring combat, there are all sorts of extra small bonuses or minuses you can get on your attacks, depending on how well you are positioned.\\nDon\'t bother with memorizing them for now. The Game Master will tell you when the time comes. Just remember positioning matters. If it makes sense that you ever get a penalty to an attack, you probably do. Ask the Game Master.\\nIf you want to see all of these penalties and bonuses, you can check the Attack Bonuses and Penalties page.\\n","Abilities":"An Ability is simply a block of text that either gives you some thing extra (passively) or gives you something else to do with your Actions rather than attacking.\\nEvery Race and Class gives you some special Abilities. You will know you have these Abilities if they are written on your character sheet.\\nIf you are a Gnome, you have some extra Abilities that Elves don\'t have.\\n\\nLet\'s take a look at exactly what Abilities you start with as a Gnome!\\n\\nFirst off, you have Inherited Tastes. You can see it\'s a Passive Ability, meaning you don\'t need to use it manually; it\'s always there, in the back of your mind. It\'s like an extra trait for your character.\\nInherited Tastes is very simple. You don\'t have a sense of taste, but your eyes perceive colors sharper than most. Doesn\'t sound like much, but it is an Ability!\\n\\nThen, let\'s look at Lucky Presence. This one is an Ability that you can actually use!\\nAfter someone else makes a Check, you can say \\"I use Lucky Presence\\" and they must roll the check again. Presumably, you would use this on your allies when they fail a Check, or on your enemies when they succeed a Check you would\'ve liked them to fail.\\nThere are 2 interesting things about this Ability: the first one is that it\'s a \\"Reaction\\". Reaction is another type of Action that you can only do on others\' turns. You can\'t do just anything with Reactions. Every Reaction is usually an Ability that has a specific time when you can use it. In this case, you must use Lucky Presence when someone makes a Check.\\nThe second thing to look at is the hourglass icon near which it says \\"Long Rest\\". This is called a Cooldown and it tells you how long you have to wait before you can use this Ability again after you use it once. If it has a Cooldown of Long Rest, that means you can use it once, and then you must finish a Long Rest before you can use it again.\\n\\nThat\'s all the Abilities Gnomes start with! Let\'s take a look at another Ability now, to see another example. We\'ll look at the Spell called Bonfire.\\nBonfire is a magical Spell, and it is only available to spell casters, like Mages and Shamans. When you cast this, you choose 1-cubic-meter zone where a bonfire is conjured, and it deals damage! The Aability text itself is self explanatory and straight-forward.\\nBonfire takes 1 Action to do. So, on your turn, you\'d have to choose between attacking and casting Bonfire. Reminder that 1 Action is the same as 2 Half-Actions. So if you cast Bonfire, you can not do anything else with your hands this turn! And if you use one hand for a Half-Action, you can\'t cast Bonfire; because you are left with a Half-Action, and Bonfire takes 1 whole Action.\\nThe last thing to notice about Bonfire is the arrow-and-target icon where it says \\"6 meters\\". This simply means the spell Bonfire has a maximum range of 6 meters. The space you choose to cast Bonfire on must be within 6 meters of you (and you must be able to see the location, of course).\\n\\nLet\'s look into an Ability that\'s a little more _Advanced_, Healing Surge.\\nThe text is very short and straight-forward - you restore 2d6 Health to a Unit. \\nThe \\"Half-Action\\" and \\"5 meters\\" tags should also be self explanatory for you by now.\\nThe \\"1 Mana\\" text refers to the cost of this Ability. The next section will explain Spellcasting.\\n  \\n","Abilities Notes":"Generally, you will have to find a way to keep track of your Abilities. Sure, you can just write down the name of each Ability you have, but then you\'d have to search it online every time you want to do something. The easiest way to keep track is with the Ability Sheet Generator, which can be found at this link.\\n","Spellcasting":"Every character has a type of \\"spellcasting\\", and it\'s always one of the following: Mana-based or Insight-based.\\nYou will see the word Spell - all Spells are Abilities. A Spell is just a normal Ability, but it\'s magical by nature.\\nLet\'s start with Mana-based, since it\'s the simpler one.\\n","Mana-based Spellcasting":"Clerics, Mages, Rogues, Warlocks and Warriors use a system of points called Mana Points.\\nYou have a number of Mana Points that you can spend to cast some Spells, and you regain all Mana Points back when you finish a Long Rest (7 in-game days of non-adventuring).\\n\\nFor a clear example, let\'s take a look at the Mage Class. As written on the Mage rules page, Mages start with 3 Mana Points. The Mage can choose to spend these points on casting Spells.\\nEach Spell specifies if and how many Mana Points it costs to cast. If you decide to cast Healing Surge, you must expend one Mana Point and then you are left with 2 Mana Points. It doesn\'t specify that Healing Surge has a Cooldown, so you can do it even twice per turn (since it takes a Half-Action) as long as you have enough Mana Points. If you don\'t have enough Mana Points to cast a Spell, you simply can\'t.\\n\\nWhen building your character, you will have to choose a number of Spells from a given list - you can\'t have them all, there are dozens in the game! You\'ll pick a few Spells to have at hand. Mages, for example, start out with 4 + your Intelligence Spells. So, if your Intelligence is 3, you must pick 7 out of all the Spells Mages can choose from. These will be all the Spells you will be able to Cast until you finish your next Long Rest (7 in-game days of non-adventuring).\\nThis is explained in further detail later on, at Character Creation.\\n\\nYou can keep track of your Mana Points on a sheet of paper, with marbles, dice, etc. It is your job to keep track of your Mana Points. Don\'t cheat!\\n","Insight-based Spellcasting":"Inherit Insight-based Spellcasting from Rules.yml","Wrapping up the basics":"Those are all the basics of the game! You can now play the game with your group!\\nAs mentioned several times, don\'t bother with remembering _everything_. It\'s merely good to have a general overview of how the game works before you get into it. It is always recommended you find a group where at least one person has experience playing any tabletop RPG, be it Pathfinder, Dungeons and Dragons or Call of Heroes. And if they have player D&D or Pathfinder but they are new to CoH, send them the D&D Transition Guide! It\'s a guide specifically for D&D players who want to learn Call of Heroes and explains all the differences and changes.\\n","Character Creation":"Building a character is one of the most fun aspects of the game and provides you with a way to express what kind of person you want to be in the adventure.
